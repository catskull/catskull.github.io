I really love [86Box](https://86box.net)! However, learning how to use it was quite daunting. I was just little kid using the family's computer to play games. I don't know anything about BIOS configuration or Windows setup/maintinence. I just want to play some games and use old software.

I realize that I'm not alone in this - many find 86Box too daunting and confusing to configure. It took me some time to get it working correctly, but I think I've finally learned enough to share what I know with you. And with the relase of **5.0**, what better time to put a little blog post together than now!

This is still a work-in-progress! For now, follow along with my video tutorial:
