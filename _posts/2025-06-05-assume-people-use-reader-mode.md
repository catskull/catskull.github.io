I recently confessed that I fully assume everyone uses Safari. I know that a lot of people don't. But I do, and I feel that I pay for it, so I should use it. I don't regularly test this website in any other browsers, but I do develop against open web standards (most of the time).

However, one assumption we should agree on is that people will use reader mode. They _should_. _You_ should. I use reader mode on my own website. I will use reader mode on your website. It's worth spending a little less time getting your _color scheme_ just right and a little more time getting your _markup_ just right.

No amount of fancy CSS is worth it if I miss half your article because reader mode doesn't work correctly. I would literally _never know_.

Use reader mode. Assume people will use reader mode.
