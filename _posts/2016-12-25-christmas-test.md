This is a test of editing a post on my Chromebook! I got a new Chromebook Acer R11 for Christmas! It's very similar to my old Acer C720, but it looks a bit better, has a much improved IPS screen (with touch), and the trackpad seems worse somehow. Overall, I think I'll like it! I hope it will work for doing C++ stuff!
