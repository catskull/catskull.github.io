I've been playing MegaMan Battle Network 3: Blue for the Gameboy Advance and they keep saying "jack in" and "jack out" and I just think it's the funniest thing. I tie dyed and screen printed my own catskull shirt (made from 100% recycled cotton made in the USA!) Shaved my beard into a {% include external_link.html href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenandoah_(beard)" text="Shenandoah" %}. 

{% assign images = site.static_files | where: "extname", ".jpeg" | where_exp: "item", "item.path contains '/assets/images/posts/photo-blog-1'" | sort_natural: "path" %}

{% for image in images %}
July {{ image.path | split: '/photo-blog-1/' | last | split: '/' | first }}
![{{ image.basename }}]({{ image.path | relative_url }}){:loading='lazy' style='min-height: 100px;'}
{% endfor %}
