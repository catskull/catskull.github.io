I've been working with the very talented [KeFF](http://konttine.tumblr.com/) for the past few weeks to come up with some artwork for my shop and online identity catskull. I couldn't be more pleased with the results! I thought I'd throw them up on here for everyone to see. Going forward, you will be seeing this artwork in all of my endeavors. Stickers would be super cool!
