This is a welcome, to you, whoever you are. I'm writing this on a Tuesday afternoon in August. It's hot, but it seems like summer might soon succumb to fall.

I don't know why you're here, or when you're here, or how you're here. On your phone? Laptop? Something that hasn't been invented yet? Paper? How did you get here? Surely you found some link somewhere that led you here, but why? What are you looking for? How can I help?

I'm glad you're here. I'm writing this for you. I want you to know that I'm glad you're reading this. It actually means a lot to me, so thank you! No matter why/where/how you're here, I'm glad you're here.

I hope that reading these words makes your life better. What are you worried about? What are you looking forward to? Did you know that every cell in your body regenerates every 10 years or so? If that's the case, then who are you? What are you?

I hope that I can communicate my thoughts to you in a way that you understand. Words often fail us and I hope you'd give me the benefit of the doubt.

I want you to know that I'm happy. I hope you are too. I know that if you're not, you can be. I used to not be happy. Sometimes, I'm not happy. Most of the time I'm happy. I try to be happy. The thing that makes the most happy is expressing gratitude for the things that make me happy: family, health, nature, people, and life. I believe in God so I give thanks to Him but I don't think it matters how you express your gratitude.

While you're here, I hope you'll consider an individual's capacity to learn and grow. I hope this website is a testament to that, for better and worse. I hope you'll give yourself a little more slack when you need it.

Don't do drugs.
