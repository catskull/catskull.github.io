Sam asked me what my favorite data structure is.[^1]

Mine is the boolean[^2].

Sam said "That's actually not a data structure."[^7] I assume he's correct. There is a single 4 year computer science university degree between us, and it does not bear my name - of that I'm sure!

However, I _also_ know for a fact that he was not subjected to Brigham Young University's Electrical and Computer Engineering 2220 "Fundamentals of Digital Systems" as I was.

Have you ever solved an n-dimensional truth table[^3] by hand? Have you ever enthusiastically submitted this photo as your homework while not even questioning _for a moment_ your own sanity?

I say to you dear sir, give me your data structure and I will gladly build it out of boolean logic. Say a boolean is too primitive? Fine, I will use an array to represent a boolean value and I will implement my own array.

Boolean algebra[^6] is the most perfect system I've ever gazed into. I have only a tenuous grasp on it, as my transcript shows. However, there is _truth_ represented in a truth table.

We live in a world that holds little regard for objectivity. It's very hard to say anything is certain. Our brains are inside dark skulls with genetically evolved organs such as eyes, skin, ears, a tongue, a nose, and hair. These systems inform our brains of our environment. We developed them gradually over a few _billion_ years, each generation being rewarded for informing their brains of environmental risks and rewards as a greater degree than the generation before, however minuscule. But we don't _know_ for _certain_ that our perception of our environment is subjective to _objective_ reality. We only really know that our perception is what allowed our ancestors to survive in their environment. Do we live in the same environment they did?

Boolean logic is not that. There is no question of statefulness, of truth. A bit is either "on" or "off". We actually get to decide what "on" even means. It could literally be anything. A hole in a paper[^4]. Actually, we've been storing data this way for longer than we've even technically had computers![^5]

Perhaps at some level, I find myself struggling to effectively communicate with others. Language seems to fail us, especially when we need it the most. So even if primitive, a boolean is my favorite data structure. It's pure. And extremely versatile. We know what it means, it's obvious.

So there you have it. My favorite data structure - the boolean. What's yours?
