I recently caught a bug to play the artfully done [Policenauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policenauts) [fan translation](http://policenauts.net/english/). I've been playing my 3DS a lot lately so I figured why not try and run it there? Surprisingly PS1 emulation works quite well once configured properly. I've tried Xenogears and Policenauts and they both run at 100%. Save states also work perfectly. This is all thanks to all the great folks contributing to PCSX-ReARMed, libretro, devkitPro, MAME, as well as the community for documentation.

Supposedly this only works for the New 3DS. Your mileage may vary. 

I'd highly recommend reading over this entire post before trying to follow along. There are a few tricky steps!

# Prepare your games

Create backups for each disc you want to play.

Install `chdman` (MacOS 10.13 and above): `brew install rom-tools`

Compress BIN+CUE to CHD using chdman: `chdman createcd -i game.cue -o game.chd`

For multi-disc games, put all your CHDs in the same folder and create a .m3u playlist file. This command will do it for you and name it the same thing the directory is named: `find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "*.chd" -exec basename {} \; > "$(basename "$(pwd)").m3u"`

Recommended: test your CHD/M3U in an emulator like duckstation.

Put your games on your 3DS SD card. I put mine in `/roms/ps1/`.

Optional: [create a backup](https://www.ngemu.com/threads/psx-bios-dumping-guide.93161/) of your PS1 BIOS and transfer `scph550X.bin` to your SD card. PCSX claims to work better with a BIOS backup but I haven't actually tested the difference.

# Install Retroarch

Install custom firmware: [https://3ds.hacks.guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide)

Download & extract retroarch 3ds build (latest stable): [https://buildbot.libretro.com/stable/1.17.0/nintendo/3ds/RetroArch_cia.7z](https://buildbot.libretro.com/stable/1.17.0/nintendo/3ds/RetroArch_cia.7z)

Inside the `retroarch_cia/` folder, there are two folders: `cia/` and `retroarch/`. `cia/` isn't used and can be discarded. Navigate to `retroarch/cores/` and delete any cia's that you don't need. In my case I only want to emulate PS1 so the folder only has `info/` folder and `pcsx_rearmed_libretro.cia` (can `info/` be deleted?).

[Download my PCSX configuration](public/files/PCSX-ReARMed.opt) and place it in `retroarch/config/PCSX-ReARMed/` (case sensitive).

[Download my retroarch configuration](public/files/retroarch.cfg) and place it in `retroarch/`.

The directory should look like this:
<pre>
└── retroarch/
    ├── assets/
    ├── cheats/
    ├── config/
    │   └── PCSX-ReARMed/
    │       └── PCSX-ReARMed.opt
    ├── cores/
    │   ├── info/
    │   └── pcsx_rearmed_libretro.cia
    ├── database/
    ├── filters/
    ├── overlays/
    ├── remaps/
    └── retroarch.cfg
</pre>

Copy the entire `retroarch/` folder to the root of you 3DS' SD card.

Open FBI, navigate to the `retroarch/cores/` directory and install PCSX. Do not delete the cia as retroarch will use it.

![Install the PCSX .cia with FBI](public/images/3ds/fbi.png)

Close FBI and you should have PCSX on your home menu!

# Configure PCSX

If you downloaded my configuration files, you can skip this step. If you experience poor performance, come here and verify your settings.

Out of the box PCSX doesn't work very well. Toggling a few settings will greatly improve performance. Load a game and then tap the screen to access the quick menu.

> Quick Menu > Core Options > Threaded Rendering = Asynchronous
>
> Quick Menu > Core Options > GPU Plugin (Advanced) > Hi-Res Downscaling = enabled

Press B repeatedly until you navigate back to the main menu (not the quick menu).

> Main Menu > Settings > Video > Synchronization > Vertical Sync (VSync) = disabled (enable this for 2d games)
>
> Main Menu > Settings > Audio > Synchronization > Syncrhonization = enabled
>
> Main Menu > Settings > Drivers > Audio = dsp_thread
>
> Main Menu > Settings > Directory > System/BIOS = wherever you put your legally obtained BIOS

Quit PCSX and reopen to reload the config.

# Tips

To load a game:

> Main Menu > Load Content > sdmc:/ (navigate to your .chd or .m3u file)

Add your games to favorites so you can launch them without navigating your SD card every time.

To swap discs for multi-disc games:

> Quick Menu > Disc Control > Eject Disc > Current Disc Index = increment by 1, then insert disc

Using the quick menu causes the currently playing audio to glitch out until you resume the game. This is considered expected behavior.

Bathe yourself in the PS1 startup sound:

> Quick Menu > Core Options > System > Show BIOS Boot Logo = enabled

If PCSX goes unresponsive, try closing the console and reopening it.

Play around with overlays in the quick menu.

Screenshots can be found in the same directory as your backups. You can change the directory in the main menu settings.
