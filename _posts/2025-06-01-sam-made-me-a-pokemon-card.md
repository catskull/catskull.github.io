# Sam made me a Pokémon card

Sam made me a Pokémon card!

I mean, he made a Pokémon card for me!

I mean, he made me _into_ a Pokémon card!

I also streamed the pack opening at his request and it was a lot of fun. Opening my own holographic card was a once in a lifetime experience, and I've pulled a Dark Charizard Holo before.

Sam doesn't want you to know that he wrote a blog post about how he made the cards, so you're on your own. There's literally _no way_ to find the blog post he wrote, since it doesn't exist. Theoretically, it's somewhere, but I couldn't tell you where and I'm sure if you just type his name into anything you won't eventually find it. His website is _not_ linked anywhere on this website at any point. Whatever you do, _do not look_ at my [/about](/about) page, as you will not find his website linked anywhere, especially not in my "friends" table, since that wouldn't make sense. Even if you find the theoretical blog post, you definitely _will not find_ any other cards, despite mine saying it's "4/9". Sorry, can't help you there.


If you were a Trading Card, what would your powers be?
