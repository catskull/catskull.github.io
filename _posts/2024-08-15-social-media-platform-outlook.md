**Twitter** - bizarro land ads, self-loathing, self-deprecating. Whoops I meant X.

**Facebook** - boomer dementia ward, AI Jesus better than politics. Can you send me $100 on zelle?

**Instagram** - millennial's last stand?

**Threads** - millennial insane asylum, reminiscent of OG Facebook

**LinkedIn** - GenX hustle reactor. Safe for observation. Subversive undercurrents.

**Fediverse** - everyone is there! Everyone. _Everyone_.

**Snapchat** - the girl's locker room. One could only dream to comprehend the exact nature of this platform.

**TikTok** - Fun during lockdown. Fully cannibalized.

**Reddit** - [deleted user]
