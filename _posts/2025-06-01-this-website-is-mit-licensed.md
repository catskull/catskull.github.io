> If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.

I retain personal copyright and trademark for Catskull, the catskull logos, my name (David DeGraw), and the domain catskull.net. You are not allowed to impersonate me in writing or any other form to the extent of the applicable legal jurisdiction.

I believe strongly in the principles of free and open source software. I have made a career out of building upon open source software. To retain any personal copyright to the software I write in my free time, using the knowledge that a cruel and loving God has bestowed upon me, feels like an affront to the very goodness that is inherent to human nature. How could I keep another from lighting their candle from my dull flame?

My greatest wish is that people will use the software I write. I'm optimistic that will include the ways I've intended it to be used, such as reading this blog, and ways that I could never imagine.
