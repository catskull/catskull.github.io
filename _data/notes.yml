From the uploader - This is a collection of 100 of the best keygen songs of all time in my subjective opinion. It's a mixture of iconic keygen music and more obscure tracks that represent keygen music and its many diverse sub-genres. All tracks recorded using XMPlay. Each song is appropriately tagged, and the metadata contains a comment pointing to their current website (if they're still active), or an archive of their work (if they aren't)."
