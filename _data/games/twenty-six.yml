    Back then I thought it was pretty cool that they included all of the gen 1 Kanto region in the post-game, and I still think it's pretty cool. It felt like you get two games for the price of one! Revisiting it now, the post-game felt a but under-polished to me. A lot of the main places are just closed now with little logical explanation, and the specific things you need to do to unlock the next town felt pretty unintuitive, but hey I'm not going to complain too much. It was a bit funny because the main protagonist of gen 1, Red, is missing. His mom is straight up like "I haven't heard from him in a long time, I hope he's okay." Turns out, he's just chilling in a cave. He serves as the last main boss of the entire game and again, I didn't struggle too much with any of his Urmans despite the fact they were quite a bit higher leveled than anything else I'd come across. The one that really wrecked me was the Snorlax. The issue is he has "rest" which fully heals him, and I didn't have any Urmans that could do much damage. It took about 5 or 6 cuts with Davey Jr. to knock him out, and by the third or fourth he'd use rest and fully heal. I had plenty of potions but nearly ran out of PP! I guess eventually I got lucky that the CPU just used some bad logic but in a real battle I would have lost for sure.

    A last criticism I'd have is that the mix of Pokemon is really not great. Caves are still filled with Geodudes and Zubats galore. Magikarps, Goldeens, and Tentacools plauge the 7 seas. Even trainer battles will reuse the same Pokemon again and again. I really wish I would have been able to at least _see_ the new Pokemon more naturally, especially considering you can go back to Kanto to see and capture the rest of the gen 1 lineup.

    I still have pretty fond memories of Pokémon Crystal and I did enjoy my time with it now. It's just not quite what I remembered it to be. I think gen 1 still holds my heart. I'm debating if I should try out gen 3, but for some reason I feel like I got a decent chunk into Ruby a few years ago and bounced off it in some frustration but I can't remember the specifics. Maybe Platinum on my DS since I really love that console.
