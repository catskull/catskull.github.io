    Back then I thought it was pretty cool that they included all of the gen 1 Kanto region in the post-game, and I still think it's pretty cool. It felt like you get two games for the price of one! Revisiting it now, the post-game felt a but under-polished to me. A lot of the main places are just closed now with little logical explanation, and the specific things you need to do to unlock the next town felt pretty unintuitive, but hey I'm not going to complain too much. It was a bit funny because the main protagonist of gen 1, Red, is missing. His mom is straight up like "I haven't heard from him in a long time, I hope he's okay." Turns out, he's just chilling in a cave. He serves as the last main boss of the entire game and again, I didn't struggle too much with any of his Urmans despite the fact they were quite a bit higher leveled than anything else I'd come across. The one that really wrecked me was the Snorlax. The issue is he has "rest" which fully heals him, and I didn't have any Urmans that could do much damage. It took about 5 or 6 cuts with Davey Jr. to knock him out, and by the third or fourth he'd use rest and fully heal. I had plenty of potions but nearly ran out of PP! I guess eventually I got lucky that the CPU just used some bad logic but in a real battle I would have lost for sure.

    A last criticism I'd have is that the mix of Pokemon is really not great. Caves are still filled with Geodudes and Zubats galore. Magikarps, Goldeens, and Tentacools plauge the 7 seas. Even trainer battles will reuse the same Pokemon again and again. I really wish I would have been able to at least _see_ the new Pokemon more naturally, especially considering you can go back to Kanto to see and capture the rest of the gen 1 lineup.

    I still have pretty fond memories of Pokémon Crystal and I did enjoy my time with it now. It's just not quite what I remembered it to be. I think gen 1 still holds my heart. I'm debating if I should try out gen 3, but for some reason I feel like I got a decent chunk into Ruby a few years ago and bounced off it in some frustration but I can't remember the specifics. Maybe Platinum on my DS since I really love that console.

    Since I enjoyed Crystal, I thought I'd see what a more "modern" Pokémon game might look like. Yes, I'm old enough that I consider a game that's old enough to vote "modern" because Crystal came out when I was in like 5th grade and Platinum came out my senior year of high school. At that time, I was way too cool to play Pokémon... well, that's not entirely true. I remember taking my DMG to school my senior year to play my copy of Red but that was mostly a publicity stunt. Up until now, I've never experienced anything past gen 2. I have to say though, _Platinum_ is a great game! I'm biased because I really just love the Nintendo DS Lite. The screens, the resolution, the bit crushed audio, it's just perfect. Platinum looks and sounds amazing. Game Freak really nailed their execution of the touch screen as well. It just serves as a platform to press buttons, there are no gimmicks. I actually used the touch screen a lot when selecting items or moves, it just felt faster to me and is easy to do even with a full finger, not even just a fingernail heaven forbid the stylus.

    Instead of the classic _Team Rocket_, this game puts you up against _Team Galactic_ which has something to do with them wanting to make a new world or something. Instead of them being just a thorn in the side of the main gym badge journey, their storyline actually felt thought out and was pretty interesting. The main leader dude is some nut job who wants to like start a whole new world that's perfect or something by doing something evil with Pokémon... I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention. At one point you go into this "upside down" shadow world where gravity is all mixed up. They made nice use of the hardware to do a cool 2.5D layout. Basically you just walk on walls, and some times the map goes isomorphic instead of just 2D. As a little gimmick and aside, I thought it was very well executed. The whole experience there only lasts a few minutes and there's not even random encounters so you really are just focusing on a complete twist on the normal formula while you navigate the strange puzzle layout. There was a part where you swim up a waterfall that is flowing up. Does that mean you swam up or down the waterfall? You swim down an up waterfall, make sense? It's just cool. Eventually you beat the boss dude and then have to take out this crazy shadow Pokémon which was easy enough but I was under-prepped so I spent a long time trying to catch it and eventually got lucky.

    The later games are much less "rock paper scissors" mechanics and teams and Pokémon are a lot better balanced so simply sticking with a single type can't 1-shot every other battle in the game. I started with the grass starter which actually kind of felt like a mistake because he never really learned any grass type moves that dominated. Instead, I relied on it's dark move and _Earthquake_, a ground type. I also got a Magikarp and evolved it to a Gyrados which was pretty good with it's Dragon and Ice moves, though I did eventually use it as my HM beast for both Surf and Waterfall, but luckily those moves are actually pretty tough. I was also given an Evee by an NPC so I raised it up into the psychic evolution, which actually ended up not really being all that useful. Finally that legendary shadow Pokémon I caught is a ghost/psychic type that was pretty good as well. Thanks to the fresh balance, the gyms were not a complete cakewalk and the elite four actually gave me a decent run for my money. I did actually have to make strategic use of a lot of potions and revives during a few of the battles. Due to having essentially four "mains", I think they were all a bit under leveled for the final trainer, but I managed. I had a fun and tricky time trying to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the new types so I had to do a few of the battles more than once when I accidentally sent out a mon that was super weak to the opponent and I'd get one-shotted. Again I wasn't really paying enough attention to fully understand the type dynamics but I survived well enough.

    My play through took me just shy of 30 hours. I didn't do any of the WiFi stuff since that's all offline and I really can't be chuffed to deal with the fan servers. I also didn't really do any of the post-game "battle island" stuff at all. I felt that the main campaign and story was quite enough of what I got, but if I was a super fan back in 2009 the rest of the content would have been fun to play, especially if I had friends to compete with online.

    I think that here in the United States we call it pressure washing, not power washing. Nevertheless, pressure washing is something that is relaxing to do. I myself own a pressure washer and spraying my garage to the point that I could literally eat off of it is something I have spent time on. I'm not sure when I heard about this game, probably saw it on some cursed short form video platform. I was interested in playing it for a while, but it wasn't available on macOS until December 2025 thanks to Apple Arcade. First an original Katamari game, now this? What's next? _Freelancer???_

    The premise is incredibly simple. You spray things off to clean them. "Things" being anything from a bike to a UFO. There are some incredibly rudimentary mechanics such as the surface material of what you're spraying mildly influencing how easily the grime comes off, but it's mostly safe to ignore completely. You can buy better pressure washers (2 in addition to the one you start with), wand extensions, and a twirly spray nozzle. You can also buy a cleaning agent spray bottle with cleaning chemicals that need to be refilled but I didn't use them at all. At the very end of the game you can buy a fancy 3-nozzled tip that is pretty useful. But really the core gameplay is just "spray things". It's not necessarily "fun" but it is relaxing in a sense. I watched Cowboy Bebop, the Pokémon cartoon, and a few Ken Burns documentaries as I played through the game. It might be a bit _too_ addicting so I'm glad it's over now.

    I actually spent quite a bit of time in December playing this one but wasn't able to get it done before the end of the year. Thanks to the Apple Arcade release, it's available on all the Apple platforms so my son and I briefly experimented with the multiplayer with him on the Apple TV and me on my Macbook but it didn't last long. I think it's just a bit too tricky for little kids to figure out. Still, they all liked watching me play. Apparently there is some story to the game but I completely missed all of it.

    Growing up, we never actually owned a copy of _Banjo-Kazooie_, but it was a game common enough that I had a chance to play it from time to time. I remember my cousin actually owned it and would let me play it. I liked that after you'd beaten the different levels, you could go back in to them and play it again. I particularly enjoyed the ability to transform into different animals, my favorite was the bee since you could fly around.

    It's a bit wild to think how good Rare in the 90's was. In a lot of ways, they were _the_ first party developer for the Nintendo 64. Anything with a Rare logo on it was basically gold. From _Diddy Kong Racing_ to _Donkey Kong 64_, I enjoyed anything they made and then some.

    Later on when I was in middle school, I ended up tracking down a copy of _Banjo_ and played through it. I remember coming home late after a dance and finally finishing off the final boss for the first time. Since then, I think I've played through it one more time, probably around 2018 when I bought an Xbox One and a copy of Rare Replay.

    The new hotness in the Nintendo 64 scene is these "recomps". I'm not totally sure what kind of black magic is involved, but they're able to take a legally obtained ROM dump of an N64 game and "recompile" it for modern platforms, and luckily they're pretty well supported on macOS. This recomp is quite good, upscaling the models and with a few quality of life tweaks such as saving notes in between levels. You see, each level has exactly 100 "notes" to collect but if you die or leave the stage, it resets which means you need to dedicate at least enough time to find them all in a single sitting. This recomp has a nice setting to save your notes so that problem isn't an issue any more.

    That's not to say my experience was flawless. At the time of writing, there's a memory leak at the rate of about 10MB/s on macOS so you're up against that clock unless you want to crash the system. Controller support is fantastic though, and I used my official Switch Online N64 controller for the perfectly authentic experience complete with rumble and everything. The biggest issue I had was that I made it to the final boss fight, died a handful of times, and then had to go give my family some attention. When I came back the next day, there was a glitch that prevented me from triggering the final fight. I quit the game and relaunched it, but now my save file was gone! I'm not sure what happened exactly but it might have something to do with the fact that I got so close to beating the boss that it triggered the final cutscene only to die by a trailing fireball post-cutscene. I literally did beat the game, but not really! I'm putting it on this list anyways since I'm not going to go back and do it all again. I unlocked everything including all 900 notes and 99 jiggies. I feel a little bit robbed that I didn't get to actually witness the final credits, but oh well that's what I get for playing some recompiled monstrosity.

    Banjo-Kazooie is a fun game, and it mostly holds up. The recomp does have a tweak for pure analog camera control if you have a controller with a second analog stick, but since I was on my N64 controller I was stuck with the default janky camera controls. Seriously, what the heck was with 90's 3D platformers and camera issues? Mario 64 is one of the worst offenders. I do not understand how the camera could be so bad and I don't understand how it's just completely not an issue any more. What did they figure out to fix it? I'll have to pay attention to the next game I play.
