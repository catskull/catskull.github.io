    Back then I thought it was pretty cool that they included all of the gen 1 Kanto region in the post-game, and I still think it's pretty cool. It felt like you get two games for the price of one! Revisiting it now, the post-game felt a but under-polished to me. A lot of the main places are just closed now with little logical explanation, and the specific things you need to do to unlock the next town felt pretty unintuitive, but hey I'm not going to complain too much. It was a bit funny because the main protagonist of gen 1, Red, is missing. His mom is straight up like "I haven't heard from him in a long time, I hope he's okay." Turns out, he's just chilling in a cave. He serves as the last main boss of the entire game and again, I didn't struggle too much with any of his Urmans despite the fact they were quite a bit higher leveled than anything else I'd come across. The one that really wrecked me was the Snorlax. The issue is he has "rest" which fully heals him, and I didn't have any Urmans that could do much damage. It took about 5 or 6 cuts with Davey Jr. to knock him out, and by the third or fourth he'd use rest and fully heal. I had plenty of potions but nearly ran out of PP! I guess eventually I got lucky that the CPU just used some bad logic but in a real battle I would have lost for sure.

    A last criticism I'd have is that the mix of Pokemon is really not great. Caves are still filled with Geodudes and Zubats galore. Magikarps, Goldeens, and Tentacools plauge the 7 seas. Even trainer battles will reuse the same Pokemon again and again. I really wish I would have been able to at least _see_ the new Pokemon more naturally, especially considering you can go back to Kanto to see and capture the rest of the gen 1 lineup.

    I still have pretty fond memories of Pokémon Crystal and I did enjoy my time with it now. It's just not quite what I remembered it to be. I think gen 1 still holds my heart. I'm debating if I should try out gen 3, but for some reason I feel like I got a decent chunk into Ruby a few years ago and bounced off it in some frustration but I can't remember the specifics. Maybe Platinum on my DS since I really love that console.

    Since I enjoyed Crystal, I thought I'd see what a more "modern" Pokémon game might look like. Yes, I'm old enough that I consider a game that's old enough to vote "modern" because Crystal came out when I was in like 5th grade and Platinum came out my senior year of high school. At that time, I was way too cool to play Pokémon... well, that's not entirely true. I remember taking my DMG to school my senior year to play my copy of Red but that was mostly a publicity stunt. Up until now, I've never experienced anything past gen 2. I have to say though, _Platinum_ is a great game! I'm biased because I really just love the Nintendo DS Lite. The screens, the resolution, the bit crushed audio, it's just perfect. Platinum looks and sounds amazing. Game Freak really nailed their execution of the touch screen as well. It just serves as a platform to press buttons, there are no gimmicks. I actually used the touch screen a lot when selecting items or moves, it just felt faster to me and is easy to do even with a full finger, not even just a fingernail heaven forbid the stylus.

    Instead of the classic _Team Rocket_, this game puts you up against _Team Galactic_ which has something to do with them wanting to make a new world or something. Instead of them being just a thorn in the side of the main gym badge journey, their storyline actually felt thought out and was pretty interesting. The main leader dude is some nut job who wants to like start a whole new world that's perfect or something by doing something evil with Pokémon... I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention. At one point you go into this "upside down" shadow world where gravity is all mixed up. They made nice use of the hardware to do a cool 2.5D layout. Basically you just walk on walls, and some times the map goes isomorphic instead of just 2D. As a little gimmick and aside, I thought it was very well executed. The whole experience there only lasts a few minutes and there's not even random encounters so you really are just focusing on a complete twist on the normal formula while you navigate the strange puzzle layout. There was a part where you swim up a waterfall that is flowing up. Does that mean you swam up or down the waterfall? You swim down an up waterfall, make sense? It's just cool. Eventually you beat the boss dude and then have to take out this crazy shadow Pokémon which was easy enough but I was under-prepped so I spent a long time trying to catch it and eventually got lucky.

    The later games are much less "rock paper scissors" mechanics and teams and Pokémon are a lot better balanced so simply sticking with a single type can't 1-shot every other battle in the game. I started with the grass starter which actually kind of felt like a mistake because he never really learned any grass type moves that dominated. Instead, I relied on it's dark move and _Earthquake_, a ground type. I also got a Magikarp and evolved it to a Gyrados which was pretty good with it's Dragon and Ice moves, though I did eventually use it as my HM beast for both Surf and Waterfall, but luckily those moves are actually pretty tough. I was also given an Evee by an NPC so I raised it up into the psychic evolution, which actually ended up not really being all that useful. Finally that legendary shadow Pokémon I caught is a ghost/psychic type that was pretty good as well. Thanks to the fresh balance, the gyms were not a complete cakewalk and the elite four actually gave me a decent run for my money. I did actually have to make strategic use of a lot of potions and revives during a few of the battles. Due to having essentially four "mains", I think they were all a bit under leveled for the final trainer, but I managed. I had a fun and tricky time trying to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the new types so I had to do a few of the battles more than once when I accidentally sent out a mon that was super weak to the opponent and I'd get one-shotted. Again I wasn't really paying enough attention to fully understand the type dynamics but I survived well enough.

    My play through took me just shy of 30 hours. I didn't do any of the WiFi stuff since that's all offline and I really can't be chuffed to deal with the fan servers. I also didn't really do any of the post-game "battle island" stuff at all. I felt that the main campaign and story was quite enough of what I got, but if I was a super fan back in 2009 the rest of the content would have been fun to play, especially if I had friends to compete with online.
