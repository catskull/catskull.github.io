  text: I'm not sure how I came across this game, but boy, I'm glad I did. I'm not really familiar with the whole [Chris Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Roberts_(video_game_developer))-verse and have never played any _Wing Commander_ games. I've been more-or-less obsessed with the entire "space cowboy" concept for about as long as I can remember. Why is it so gripping? _Freelancer_ is everything I've ever wanted out of a "space game". Here's the thing about outer space - it's mostly empty, which is also pretty boring. A lot of "space games" get caught up trying to work around this since your options are to make it boring or unlrealistic. _Freelancer_ has a very basic gameplay loop – land on planet, get job, go into space, do job (usually in the form of flying to a specific place and shooting a group of bad guys), earn money, upgrade ship, repeat. At face value, it's boring and repetitive. However, the actual space combat itself is just so well done and engaging that it's really actually addicting. The game also does a fantastic job with some really well done voice acting and cutscene work, well ahead of it's time. Unfortunately this game is mostly lost to obscurity and you can't even buy it anymore. Despite that, there is a passionate community of players and mods in the [_Discovery_](https://discoverygc.com) scene, but I haven't gotten into that yet. Honestly, I want to just play the main campaign again and take my time with it. By the way – how was this game not on the original Xbox? I _yearn_ for an alternate past where this game launched on Xbox Live in 2003. It would have been incredible.

  text: I've never played any of the _Half-Life_ games. The only Valve game I know that I've played is _Portal_. I decided I'd find out what the fuss was about. Officially, there's no way to play the original _Half-Life_ on Mac without emulation. Fortunately, [MacSourcePorts](https://www.macsourceports.com/game/halflife) has a version available. It's using a project called [xash3d-fwgs](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs), an open-source implementation of the original _Half-Life_ engine (GoldSrc). Playing at 75hz on my little 4:3 SyncMaster LCD is quite engrossing and feels very authentic. It's probably not fully fair to put _Uplink_ on this list, but I'm doing it anyways. _Uplink_ is a HL demo that has a small standalone campaign. It used to be very obscure, but Valve included it in the Anniversary release of _Half-Life_ so everyone can play it. It really is a great little preview of the full game and is probably worth playing through before starting the campaign if nothing else as an extended tutorial as I found the difficulty to be a lot lower.

    Here's some raw output from my notes:
    - robot voice sounds awesome (kraftwerk)
    - screaming butthole dogs?
    - gonarch
    - "Just keep shooting at the B A L L"
    - helicopter is way annoying
    I have a theory - first-person shooters should not have a jump mechanism. I can totally see why Counter-Strike took off in a way that Half-Life didn't as much - the combat and shooting is _so tight_ and the AI is actually pretty fun. There's human soldiers and aliens (butthole pigs) trying to kill you, so you have to keep shaking up your weapon of choice and strategy. Ammo runs pretty low usually so get comfortable with all the weapons. It's not without it's flaws but overall Half-Life was pretty fun, cursed biology notwithstanding. Seriously, jumping into the three-armed baby's head and shooting it's floating electric orb brain until it dies. I'm excited to continue the Half-Life-verse.

  text: I admit I did get _Blue Shift_ running on my Dreamcast at some point and made it far enough that the save file eventually exceeded the size of the total VMU capacity and it wouldn't let me continue. I don't remember much as I didn't get far. This is a pretty weak expansion overall. It's fine but offers no real "new" content beyond just more of the same thing you got in _Half-Life_ and it actually doesn't even have all of the weapons (unless I missed something). The entire end sequence with draining a coolant pool, moving barrels to jump on, filling it back up and beyond is just kind of not fun. The end sequence in particular is really weak, just listening to some NPC do some random stuff off-screen. And at the end they just... drive away? It feels like the "best parts" of this game are supposed to be little glimpses of the Gordon Freeman storyline but it's not enough to keep me going. Play if you love Half-Life but don't feel bad if you skip this one.
