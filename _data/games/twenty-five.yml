  text: I'm not sure how I came across this game, but boy, I'm glad I did. I'm not really familiar with the whole [Chris Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Roberts_(video_game_developer))-verse and have never played any _Wing Commander_ games. I've been more-or-less obsessed with the entire "space cowboy" concept for about as long as I can remember. Why is it so gripping? _Freelancer_ is everything I've ever wanted out of a "space game". Here's the thing about outer space - it's mostly empty, which is also pretty boring. A lot of "space games" get caught up trying to work around this since your options are to make it boring or unlrealistic. _Freelancer_ has a very basic gameplay loop – land on planet, get job, go into space, do job (usually in the form of flying to a specific place and shooting a group of bad guys), earn money, upgrade ship, repeat. At face value, it's boring and repetitive. However, the actual space combat itself is just so well done and engaging that it's really actually addicting. The game also does a fantastic job with some really well done voice acting and cutscene work, well ahead of it's time. Unfortunately this game is mostly lost to obscurity and you can't even buy it anymore. Despite that, there is a passionate community of players and mods in the [_Discovery_](https://discoverygc.com) scene, but I haven't gotten into that yet. Honestly, I want to just play the main campaign again and take my time with it. By the way – how was this game not on the original Xbox? I _yearn_ for an alternate past where this game launched on Xbox Live in 2003. It would have been incredible.

  platform: PC (xash3d-fwgs)

  text: I've never played any of the _Half-Life_ games. The only Valve game I know that I've played is _Portal_. I decided I'd find out what the fuss was about. Officially, there's no way to play the original _Half-Life_ on Mac without emulation. Fortunately, [MacSourcePorts](https://www.macsourceports.com/game/halflife) has a version available. It's using a project called [xash3d-fwgs](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs), an open-source implementation of the original _Half-Life_ engine (GoldSrc). Playing at 75hz on my little 4:3 SyncMaster LCD is quite engrossing and feels very authentic. It's probably not fully fair to put _Uplink_ on this list, but I'm doing it anyways. _Uplink_ is a HL demo that has a small standalone campaign. It used to be very obscure, but Valve included it in the Anniversary release of _Half-Life_ so everyone can play it. It really is a great little preview of the full game and is probably worth playing through before starting the campaign if nothing else as an extended tutorial as I found the difficulty to be a lot lower.

    Here's some raw output from my notes:
    - robot voice sounds awesome (kraftwerk)
    - screaming butthole dogs?
    - gonarch
    - "Just keep shooting at the B A L L"
    - helicopter is way annoying
    I have a theory - first-person shooters should not have a jump mechanism. I can totally see why Counter-Strike took off in a way that Half-Life didn't as much - the combat and shooting is _so tight_ and the AI is actually pretty fun. There's human soldiers and aliens (butthole pigs) trying to kill you, so you have to keep shaking up your weapon of choice and strategy. Ammo runs pretty low usually so get comfortable with all the weapons. It's not without it's flaws but overall Half-Life was pretty fun, cursed biology notwithstanding. Seriously, jumping into the three-armed baby's head and shooting it's floating electric orb brain until it dies. I'm excited to continue the Half-Life-verse.

  text: I admit I did get _Blue Shift_ running on my Dreamcast at some point and made it far enough that the save file eventually exceeded the size of the total VMU capacity and it wouldn't let me continue. I don't remember much as I didn't get far. This is a pretty weak expansion overall. It's fine but offers no real "new" content beyond just more of the same thing you got in _Half-Life_ and it actually doesn't even have all of the weapons (unless I missed something). The entire end sequence with draining a coolant pool, moving barrels to jump on, filling it back up and beyond is just kind of not fun. The end sequence in particular is really weak, just listening to some NPC do some random stuff off-screen. And at the end they just... drive away? It feels like the "best parts" of this game are supposed to be little glimpses of the Gordon Freeman storyline but it's not enough to keep me going. Play if you love Half-Life but don't feel bad if you skip this one.

  text: I played this around when it came out by saving my lunch money for a few months to buy an Xbox 360 and borrowed my friend's copy of _The Orange Box_. For whatever reason, I never got into any of the other games but _Portal_ was different. The entire GlaDOS narrative was just mind-blowingly cool to me then, and it still holds up! And then the credit song. I'm not going to lie, I sat in my office and sobbed. It's just such a fun game and a pleasant experience. GlaDOS feels like as much of antagonist to the test subject as the game itself is to me. Provocative yet irritatingly engaging. Good one for kids too!

  text: I played the first _SteamWorld Dig_ game on my 3DS in 2015 after buying it as part of the first ([and only](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Humble_Nindie_Bundle)) "Humble Nindie Bundle". It's a game that on the surface seems to have almost no real appeal but if you commit to playing it for 5 minutes, I bet you'll play the whole thing. The gameplay is just _so fun_. It's hard to describe - like a dig dug metroidvania. Overall the graphics, sound, story, and music are mostly forgettable , aside from one surprising "glitch in the matrix" event. I really enjoyed this game and it's improved on the original in pretty much every way, so if you haven't played either you're safe to jump right into the sequel. Highly recommended!

  text: After I beat the original _SteamWorld Dig_ in 2015, I was excited to see the next game in the series. I was initially very turned off by _SteamWorld Heist_. It's a 2D turn-based strategy platformer. Image & Form really know how to innovate on some existing game styles, and they do it very well. It's mission based and the maps are somewhat randomly generated. Enough that if you die or give up, you get something that's not exactly the same the next time. It also means sometimes you just get a bad dice roll and things go south. The only real penalty is your money (gallons of water because they are robots that run on steam) and money isn't really that useful. The game will give you new gear and weapons to use and my strategy was to use the new weapons. It's class-based, so you recruit a team of specialists. Before each mission, you'll select 1, 2, 3, or 4 members of your team and load them out with gear and weapons. Team members are rewarded in experience points and will unlock new abilites that make your life easier. For this reason, you end up a bit with the Pokémon issue of only levelling up your favorite members of your party. It's not all bad, I found bundling an under-leveled team member in with more experienced members worked out just fine. And you can always go back and re-play old missions with new team members. I got pretty addicted and it was a little frustrating. I played through on the normal difficulty but had to drop down to easy for the sub-boss fight that was just insane.

- title: The Lost Vikings
  platform: SNES (OpenEmu experimental macOS ARM build)
  developer: Silicon & Synapse
  publisher: Interplay Productions
  year: 1993

  text: Silicon & Synapse started in the late 80's as a contract studio to port other games. It's a solid business plan and one that is still pretty lucrative if you're good at your target platforms. _The Lost Vikings_ was their first original IP and is a real-time team-based puzzle-platformer. Kind of like Lemmings, but you have three Vikings. Each Viking has a set of unique abilities - one can jump and run, one can fight, one can block and use a shield as a parasail. There's fall damage like no tomorrow. Each level is basically a unique puzzle. The game is split into "worlds" and each world has a few levels. The music is so much better than it has any right to be, and this was pretty early in the SNES lifecycle as well. The gameplay is just fun! The levels are designed extremely well. I had to use the hint book a few times, and as always I make heavy use of save states. With those handicaps, it was an enjoyable experience.

- title: The Lost Vikings 2
  platform: SNES (OpenEmu experimental macOS ARM build)
  developer: Blizzard Entertainment

  text: So the first game was some random company and the second game was... _Blizzard_? As in _the_ Blizzard? Yes! Almost immediately after _The Lost Vikings_, they changed their name to _Blizzard Entertainment_. And then Warcraft, Warcraft II, and Diablo happened. Not to mention StarCraft a year later. Those are three of the absolute best and most popular games of the 90's. Blizzard was on fire! I assume The Lost Vikings 2 was in development/planning for a while and then Warcraft was such a huge surprise hit that it took a while for it to get the right people on the project and by the time they did, the N64 was already out and frankly Blizzard had better stuff to do. But apprently Interplay was happy to publish it to mediocre sales which is unfortunate, because this is a true sequel to an already great game. Difficulty and puzzle-wise, it picks right up where the first game left off. Each Viking how has some additional abilities (runner has jetpack boots and can swim, fighter has a robot arm to swing around, shield guy can... fart). They also added a werewolf and a dragon. The wolf can wall jump and melee attach. The dragon can fly and shoot fire balls. You still only play with 3 at a time, they just swap in and out at random. This one felt shorter than the first, but not too short. The final boss is quite a bit more spread out in this game. I should also mention that there is a PS1 port of this game that's exactly the same game gameplay-wise, but literally all the graphics and assets are different including full voice acting that's not bad! It wasn't developed by Blizzard so I opted for the SNES version, but this isn't a bad option at all!
