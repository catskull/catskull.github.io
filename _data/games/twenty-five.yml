  text: I'm not sure how I came across this game, but boy, I'm glad I did. I'm not really familiar with the whole [Chris Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Roberts_(video_game_developer))-verse and have never played any _Wing Commander_ games. I've been more-or-less obsessed with the entire "space cowboy" concept for about as long as I can remember. Why is it so gripping? _Freelancer_ is everything I've ever wanted out of a "space game". Here's the thing about outer space - it's mostly empty, which is also pretty boring. A lot of "space games" get caught up trying to work around this since your options are to make it boring or unlrealistic. _Freelancer_ has a very basic gameplay loop – land on planet, get job, go into space, do job (usually in the form of flying to a specific place and shooting a group of bad guys), earn money, upgrade ship, repeat. At face value, it's boring and repetitive. However, the actual space combat itself is just so well done and engaging that it's really actually addicting. The game also does a fantastic job with some really well done voice acting and cutscene work, well ahead of it's time. Unfortunately this game is mostly lost to obscurity and you can't even buy it anymore. Despite that, there is a passionate community of players and mods in the [_Discovery_](https://discoverygc.com) scene, but I haven't gotten into that yet. Honestly, I want to just play the main campaign again and take my time with it. By the way – how was this game not on the original Xbox? I _yearn_ for an alternate past where this game launched on Xbox Live in 2003. It would have been incredible.

  text: I've never played any of the _Half-Life_ games. The only Valve game I know that I've played is _Portal_. I decided I'd find out what the fuss was about. Officially, there's no way to play the original _Half-Life_ on Mac without emulation. Fortunately, [MacSourcePorts](https://www.macsourceports.com/game/halflife) has a version available. It's using a project called [xash3d-fwgs](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs), an open-source implementation of the original _Half-Life_ engine (GoldSrc). Playing at 75hz on my little 4:3 SyncMaster LCD is quite engrossing and feels very authentic. It's probably not fully fair to put _Uplink_ on this list, but I'm doing it anyways. _Uplink_ is a HL demo that has a small standalone campaign. It used to be very obscure, but Valve included it in the Anniversary release of _Half-Life_ so everyone can play it. It really is a great little preview of the full game and is probably worth playing through before starting the campaign if nothing else as an extended tutorial as I found the difficulty to be a lot lower.

    Here's some raw output from my notes:
    - robot voice sounds awesome (kraftwerk)
    - screaming butthole dogs?
    - gonarch
    - "Just keep shooting at the B A L L"
    - helicopter is way annoying
    I have a theory - first-person shooters should not have a jump mechanism. I can totally see why Counter-Strike took off in a way that Half-Life didn't as much - the combat and shooting is _so tight_ and the AI is actually pretty fun. There's human soldiers and aliens (butthole pigs) trying to kill you, so you have to keep shaking up your weapon of choice and strategy. Ammo runs pretty low usually so get comfortable with all the weapons. It's not without it's flaws but overall Half-Life was pretty fun, cursed biology notwithstanding. Seriously, jumping into the three-armed baby's head and shooting it's floating electric orb brain until it dies. I'm excited to continue the Half-Life-verse.

  text: I admit I did get _Blue Shift_ running on my Dreamcast at some point and made it far enough that the save file eventually exceeded the size of the total VMU capacity and it wouldn't let me continue. I don't remember much as I didn't get far. This is a pretty weak expansion overall. It's fine but offers no real "new" content beyond just more of the same thing you got in _Half-Life_ and it actually doesn't even have all of the weapons (unless I missed something). The entire end sequence with draining a coolant pool, moving barrels to jump on, filling it back up and beyond is just kind of not fun. The end sequence in particular is really weak, just listening to some NPC do some random stuff off-screen. And at the end they just... drive away? It feels like the "best parts" of this game are supposed to be little glimpses of the Gordon Freeman storyline but it's not enough to keep me going. Play if you love Half-Life but don't feel bad if you skip this one.

And then the credit song. I'm not going to lie, I sat in my office and sobbed. It's just such a fun game and a pleasant experience. GlaDOS feels like as much of antagonist to the test subject as the game itself is to me. Provocative yet irritatingly engaging. Good one for kids too!

It's hard to describe - like a dig dug metroidvania. Overall the graphics, sound, story, and music are mostly forgettable , aside from one surprising "glitch in the matrix" event. I really enjoyed this game and it's improved on the original in pretty much every way, so if you haven't played either you're safe to jump right into the sequel. Highly recommended!

  text: After I beat the original _SteamWorld Dig_ in 2015, I was excited to see the next game in the series. I was initially very turned off by _SteamWorld Heist_. It's a 2D turn-based strategy platformer. Image & Form really know how to innovate on some existing game styles, and they do it very well. It's mission based and the maps are somewhat randomly generated. Enough that if you die or give up, you get something that's not exactly the same the next time. It also means sometimes you just get a bad dice roll and things go south. The only real penalty is your money (gallons of water because they are robots that run on steam) and money isn't really that useful. The game will give you new gear and weapons to use and my strategy was to use the new weapons. It's class-based, so you recruit a team of specialists. Before each mission, you'll select 1, 2, 3, or 4 members of your team and load them out with gear and weapons. Team members are rewarded in experience points and will unlock new abilites that make your life easier. For this reason, you end up a bit with the Pokémon issue of only levelling up your favorite members of your party. It's not all bad, I found bundling an under-leveled team member in with more experienced members worked out just fine. And you can always go back and re-play old missions with new team members. I got pretty addicted and it was a little frustrating. I played through on the normal difficulty but had to drop down to easy for the sub-boss fight that was just insane.

It's a solid business plan and one that is still pretty lucrative if you're good at your target platforms. _The Lost Vikings_ was their first original IP and is a real-time team-based puzzle-platformer. Kind of like Lemmings, but you have three Vikings. Each Viking has a set of unique abilities - one can jump and run, one can fight, one can block and use a shield as a parasail. There's fall damage like no tomorrow. Each level is basically a unique puzzle. The game is split into "worlds" and each world has a few levels. The music is so much better than it has any right to be, and this was pretty early in the SNES lifecycle as well. The gameplay is just fun! The levels are designed extremely well. I had to use the hint book a few times, and as always I make heavy use of save states. With those handicaps, it was an enjoyable experience.

  text: So the first game was some random company and the second game was... _Blizzard_? As in _the_ Blizzard? Yes! Almost immediately after _The Lost Vikings_, they changed their name to _Blizzard Entertainment_. And then Warcraft, Warcraft II, and Diablo happened. Not to mention StarCraft a year later. Those are three of the absolute best and most popular games of the 90's. Blizzard was on fire! I assume The Lost Vikings 2 was in development/planning for a while and then Warcraft was such a huge surprise hit that it took a while for it to get the right people on the project and by the time they did, the N64 was already out and frankly Blizzard had better stuff to do. But apprently Interplay was happy to publish it to mediocre sales which is unfortunate, because this is a true sequel to an already great game. Difficulty and puzzle-wise, it picks right up where the first game left off. Each Viking how has some additional abilities (runner has jetpack boots and can swim, fighter has a robot arm to swing around, shield guy can... fart). They also added a werewolf and a dragon. The wolf can wall jump and melee attach. The dragon can fly and shoot fire balls. You still only play with 3 at a time, they just swap in and out at random. This one felt shorter than the first, but not too short. The final boss is quite a bit more spread out in this game. I should also mention that there is a PS1 port of this game that's exactly the same game gameplay-wise, but literally all the graphics and assets are different including full voice acting that's not bad! It wasn't developed by Blizzard so I opted for the SNES version, but this isn't a bad option at all!

   On September 20, 2019 I walked into a Bic Camera in Tokyo, Japan and bought a copy of "The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening" and a grey Switch Lite, both of which had been released that day. While I enjoy the remaster, I was disappointed by it's poor performance and overall felt the gameplay was lacking some of the charm that made the original and it's re-release so appealing. I'm sure it's likely due to a healthy dose of nostalgia. I remember playing, and enjoying, Link's Awakening as a kid growing up in the 90's. I owned a Game Boy but not this game, so I was relegated to quick play sessions at a friend's house. I appreciated multiple save files - usually there was a free space for me to save my game. I never made it very far, but the entire intro sequence was just so unassuming yet inviting to me. Later I remember borrowing the DX release from my older brother's friend and getting maybe half way before losing interest or having to give it back. I'm pretty sure Link's Awakening was my intro to the Zelda franchise. Later we'd own Ocerena of Time and Windwaker, but those are other stories. The game holds up pretty well. I played with the ["redux" romhack](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/4672/) which just tweaks a few very minor inconveniences. Still, the copious amount of back tracking did get old. Thankfully, the game doesn't overstay it's welcome. By the final dungeon, I was pretty much done with the persistant menuing to get items equipped. But then, it ended! I beat it! I liked Link's Awakening then, and I like it now. As a kid it was just a game I could pick up and play even if I didn't know what to do. My kids agree, letting them take a turn for a few minutes hacking away at baddies and grass is easy and smooth.

  text: Another entry in the "it was on the family computer growing up". I played this one a lot growing up. The completely unforgiving platforming, combined with the extremely forgiving and quick resets makes this a very good game to suck at. Indeed, my 4 year old took over half way through this one, including the combat. As always I made copious use of save states to get through each section flawlessly, but it really doesn't detract at all from the game. The platforming is _fun_. Really fun. The low quality rotoscoped animations have aged like fine wine and look even better today than ever. The platforming is somewhat slow and deliberate, as any "cinematic platformer" (as they'd later come to be called) should be. _Prince of Persia_ is an inviting and forgiving game to play for all ages and I'd highly recommend you give it a shot. It was also ported to pretty much every console around, and I'm sure those ports are all fine. Just give it a whirl!

  text: It's a bit difficult to try and make sense of the early Blizzard Entertainment timeline. After 1993's "The Lost Vikings", the gang followed up with a another fresh IP - Blackthorne. The story is mostly unimportant and forgettable, but I did pick up on the same root ideas that would clearly later influence both Warcraft and Diablo to some extent in both theme and art style. Diving straight into Blackthorne after TLV, it's clear to see how similar the games really are which is when I realized that The Lost Vikings is also _technically_ a "cinematic platformer" as well. Following on the major success of _Prince of Persia_, _Flashback_, and _Another World_, Blizzard fired up the Lost Vikings' engine and cranked out a cinematic platformer of their own. As always copious save states made the game quicker and more enjoyable. The game is broken into levels with a few different "areas" where the graphics will change. Progression usually looks like moving from the entrance to the exit, solving various platforming puzzles along the way such as finding key items or accessing hard to reach locations. The level design is really good, flows naturally and I rarely had to rely on a guide or walkthrough. A staple of the "cinematic platformer" genre is combat sequence breaks. Kind of like a 2D Time Crisis if you're played that arcade classic - take cover, shoot, take cover. The combat isn't anywhere as engaging or smooth as _Prince of Persia_, but shooting the gun is fun and you're treated with decent upgrades along the way to keep the gameplay fresh. Like the other Blizzard games on this list, it packs in just the right amount of content to feel like you had an opportunity to really nail the platforming without going on longer than it needs to.

    "It was on the family computer growing up". I actually later personally bought the SNES port after that computer had fallen out of repair because I liked it. This game has captivated me for a long time. It came out in 1991 which was the year I was born and it was on our computer from the time I can remember. Playing this game with my Dad is one of my earliest and most distinct memories. Have you ever seen anything like this before, or since? I haven't really. Artist, programmer, and overall genius Éric Chahi previously worked on _Future Wars_ which I played through last year. Chahi implemented the game as a virtual machine with all vector graphics which is why it was ported so easily and mostly very well to pretty much every system. Are you getting the picture yet? If you make a game that runs on literally everything, you'll sell a lot more copies! After a Grammy-worthy opening cinematic, you're teleported to the bottom of a giant pool of water. As you swim to the surface, some form of alien tentacle begins to reach for your kicking legs. As you climb out just in time, you're greated with a bleak alien landscape. Something moves behind you. Welcome to Another World! The game almost plays like an interactive story book. The puzzles are challenging yet rewarding. I'm truly filled with a sense of wonder as I'm taken through the game's story, each new environment more unique and interesting than the last. This is worth spending a few minutes of your time with!

As a kid, I liked the art and voices. I understood the basics of RTS gameplay but likely never made it much past the first few missions. Just like then, I made it to the first cave level for the Orc campaign and decided I'd rather cheat my way through than deal with the poor unit command options. The possibility of complex unit command structures is there, but the UI just make it so incredibly difficult. I think it's 100% beatable as-is. I just ran out of steam brute-forcing it. Cheating my way through the rest of the Orc and the Human campaigns was actually pretty fun! It's fun to see the misssions as the story and map unfold on both sides. The voice acting is really good, and the art is fun and chunky. I think Dune II is a better RTS overall, but Warcraft proves once again Blizzard knew how to make a compelling entry into an (at the time) uncommon genre.

    _Katamari Damacy Rolling LIVE_ is the first new mainline entry into the _Katamari_ series since 2011's mobile-exclusive "Touch My Katamari". I think _Rolling LIVE_ is overlooked as another mobile exclusive, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. The game boasts 4K 120fps support on all the Apple platforms that support it. It's not some watered-down mobile port. It's a full-fledged entry into the series! In my opinion, this is the best _Katamari_ game yet. It has you helping The King collaborate with "streamers" to build your streaming channel. The "streamers" are random people with specific requests, from a man in an eating contest asking you to roll him into as much food as possible, to an Alien wanting you to roll up the entire world. I think the live-streaming aspect of the game is an extremely original take on the series that just makes the game more fun to play without actually changing any of the core gameplay. In fact, if anything, it helps make a bit more sense of the story. Rolling up everything in sight while beeing cheered on by your chat is just such a pleasant experience. The soundtrack is _phenominal_, and you can listen it on all streaming platforms. My favorite track is the blissfully cheery "Making a Star" which serves as the perfect juxtaposition for rolling up screaming and kicking people into your Katamari.

I intend to keep buying and playing, and talking about Katamari until the air leaves my chest for the final time. I like to consider _Katamari_ literally. What if you were sitting in your living room, and a little cool dude came rolling a ball through? At first, it's fine because it's just like crumbs and other stuff. But then he comes through again, and dang it he just stole your shoe. Finally, he comes through and rolls YOU up. But here's the thing: it's not a problem! Getting rolled up by a _Katamari_ is literally the best-case scenario for your life!
    <br>
    I'd like to thank Bandai Namco for developing this game, and Apple Arcade for releasing it to the masses. I think everyone should play this game from ages 1 to 100. It's universal.

  text: Of all the Parodius games, this one is my favorite. I'm loving the trend in 2025 of "completly random games I had no intention of playing". _Jikkyō Oshaberi Parodius ~forever with me~_ is the 4th entry in Konami's _Gradius_ parody series _Parodius_. Where _Gradius_ has a theme of space, _Parodius_ has a theme of absurd. I truly do not know what kind of crack the designers at _Konami_ were smoking in the 90's but I'm really glad they were! I don't play "shmups" often, they stress me out and I, generally speaking, suck at video games. Back in the day I had _Parodius Collection_ on my PSP and just found it to be super engaging and easy to pick up casually. After watching a _My Life In Gaming_ stream where they played _Adventure Island II_, I got an itch to play my own insane 90's Japanese pixel art game. Parodius! I love that game! I picked this specific entry at random. The title implies that the game has a game-show style announcer. As someone who speaks zero Japanese, this means that throughout the game, a random Japanese voice will shout things at me. I love it! My favorite is when you get a fairy (no clue what it does), he'll say "yeah" in the funniest way. It's literally the sole motivation I have to get the fairies, just to hear him. Each level is truly a children's book on acid and every segment has me on the edge of my seat, eager to see what insanities they've cooked up. They even took the "cat bus" concept one step further and one of the final bosses is a "cat train"! There are lots of "ships" to choose from, each representing something absurd. I played through as the baby. A literal flying baby - that's the ship. The music is mostly remixes of classical music and they did such a fantastic job! I made heavy use of Duckstation's rewind feature, which made the game a challening but completely frutstration-free experience for me. Highly highly recommend, I loved this one.

I played with the Japanese translation which is to say I have no idea what the story means, if there is one. I can say it's a straightforward, forgiving, and fun horizontally scrolling shooter. Instead of the _Gradius_ style power ups, you have access to all of your weapons at all times. You can power up to get 2 sub guns which makes you pretty tough. I used the normal bullets and mowed everything down easily enough on "Easy" diffuculty. I went back and did the first 2 stages on "Very Hard" difficulty, and it still wasn't so bad. This is definately not on the level of a _Parodius_ game in terms of inventiveness, but it's a great two player game you're sure to have fun with.

  text: The second and third _Parodius_ games in one package! They're both just as fun as the next. Having now played through all the mainline _Parodius_ games (except the very first one), I think that _Jikkyō Oshaberi Parodius ~forever with me~_ is my overall favorite. I think that's the culmination of the crazy ideas _Parodius_ represents.

  text: I don't know where I heard of this game or why it was on my computer, but it was and I'm very happy. Apparently this is based on a 1970's Japanese manga called _Time Boken_ from the studio most famous in the US for _Speed Racer_. The game consists of 7 or 8 levels. Before each, you choose from a handful of mech-vehicles to pilot. Each ship behaves differently and they're all fun to play, so it actually makes for quite a bit of genuine replay value. I found myself playing through stages two or three times. It's a vertical shooter and the pixel art is a great example of the peak of the 2D/16 bit SNES look we saw glimpses of on the Playstation. I really enjoyed this one and I can definately see myself coming back to this, assuming I will be able to remember the name.

  text: The only thing better than an obscure PS1 shmup based on an obscure manga is the _sequel_ to such a game! It's more of pretty much the same, which is good in my opinion. There's nothing here that fundamentally shakes up the gameplay. You could start with this one just as easily as the first. Unfortunately this seems to be where the _Time Boken_ shmup series ends. I can't even find anything about the developer of this game, did they do anything else? I'm not even totally positive _Eleven_ is the developer, that's just what the Time Bokan wiki says! If there's more games in this series, I'd love to play them. I did find a racing game _Bokan Go Go Go_, maybe I'll give it a shot.

  text: Mystical Ninja! I was introduced to this game by illegally downloading a ROM in 2001 and playing it on Snes9x on my brother's computer. I was immediately taken with the unique charm. Set in feudal Japan, Mystical Ninja's story is mostly irrelevant beyond the need for a joke. And the jokes are quite silly! The game refuses to take itself seriously. Some of the platforming sections are challenging. 2-player mode in theory is great, but in practice my kids made it hard or impossible to not die. Lots of great 90's Konami art and design with more easter eggs and throwbacks to keep track of. The game has the entire first level of Gradius fully playable in-game! The game is filled with little fun things like this, I think it wants you to hang out in mystical Japan just as much as it wants you to beat the campaign. Good music, good graphics, tight platforming. I like it! It's shorter too, only a couple of hours to play through.

  text: Being a fan of _Mystical Ninja_ I became familiar that it was actually a part of a much larger series in Japan, based on historical characters, similar to something like Robin Hood or Johnny Appleseed - folk heroes. In 2005 my family got a broadband connection and I can remember searching up the Nintendo 64 Geomon games on eBay and offering a "best offer" listing $20 off their listed $120 price and they replied "Not for this incredible treasure!" To this day, the only _Goemon_ game I had ever played was _Mystical Ninja_. I changed that! Goemon 2 improves on the first game in pretty much every way. You can tell that _Super Mario World_ came out during/after the first game had been developed. The second game goes so far as to almost be a spoof of SMW. An overhead map replaces the direct linearity of stages in the first game. They even introduce a couple of "alternate exits" a-la SMW, but as far as I could tell they were both single-route deviations, not an entire new path like SMW. Still, what's there is there and it's good! My favorite addition is the new mecha stages! I love mechs and mecha-anime. Each boss fight has you controlling a mech, first in an "endless runner" type stage, smashing towns and enemies as you go. Then, a first-person Punch-Out style fight! You can hit a left hook or a right hook and have to deflect and punch the boss at the right time. It's really fun! And funny too! It's a bit less all over the place compared to the first game, and I like both for what they are.

  text: We had this growing up. It was one of the few games on Game Boy I played as a child. I can remember bringing it with me to visit my dad at his office to ask him to help me beat a level. He obliged and of course I immediately died. I must have been 3 or 4. This one is a bit odd - it released in North America first and a few months later in Japan. There are a few fairly critical design flaws. Just issues in the level design where the difficulty seems to be accidentally extreme just for a single jump. I cheat, and use save states, so I was able to get past without too much pain. But if I didn't have that, I don't know that this game is even beatable. It's too bad because other than a few issues, it's really fun! Good music, nice graphics, and the platforming is as tight as any Konami game. You'll traverse 4 distinct movie sets and each has a few stages plus a themed boss fight. I liked it as a kid, and I still like it. It's enjoyable enough that even a 4 year old can spend 15 minutes with it and have some fun.

  text: |
    Lore drop: in high school I dated this girl and on her family computer they had one of the worst clones of Puzzle Bobble I've ever seen. But Puzzle Bobble is such a _cloneable_ game that even a bad clone is still fun as heck. We'd go head to head and I'd beat her to the point of her rage quitting. Getting a little bubble to nudge up right where it should be is really freaking satisfying. I just like poppin' bubbles, man. Generally speaking I think the PS1 got relatively okay arcade ports of most random Japanese stuff, and emulation is really good thanks to Duckstation. I briefly considered trying out the arcade version via MAME but PS1 is just so easy.
    
    Puzzle Bobble 3 was released in 1996 in arcades. It was eventually "localized" and released in the US as "Bust-A-Move '99". More like "bust-a-nut", am I right? I won't bite the hand that feeds though. I think most of the Puzzle Bobble games are about on par with each other in terms of gameplay - which is to say _incredibly satisfying and addicting_. To be honest, the game might technically be a form of gambling, but I won't get into the specifics of that. I tend to like the earlier 16/32 bit look of the earlier games, but I'm warming up to the bland "2002" PS2 look the low-quality releases of that time had.

    Like I said, I'm generally not a fan of the early PS2 low-budget aesthetic. This one doesn't even bother to fill up an entire CD-ROM, let alone a DVD! But I have to say, I lost quite a bit of the charm I felt with the earlier titles with this one. I really just think I prefer the 90's aesthetic for these games. The bubbles just don't pop with the same zest they used to. I think I'll go backward, not forward. This game is notable for having the worst voice acting I've personally seen in a game. Nobody plays Puzzle Bobble for the story, but the presentation here is almost offensively bad. Just skip. You're here for the bubbles not for the voice acting.

    As a broke kid with internet access, I spent a lot of time diging through archives of "abandonware" DOS games looking for hidden gems. One day I was playing "Space Wars" on my Palm Pilot and a long time family friend asked if I'd ever read _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. It immediately struck a chord. As I read and researched, I found the interactive fiction adaptation co-designed by Douglas Adams himself and Steve Meretzky.

    I found the strictly text-only interface to be a little overwhelming, which is why when I discovered the crop of early _Legend Entertainment_ interactive fictions, I jumped at them immediately. It's everything I love about IF and everything I love about retro DOS gaming - great art, animations, and soundtrack! It really makes for quite an immersive experience.
    
    Eventually I read the _Gateway_ books, my favorite being the first sequel _Beyond the Blue Event Horizon_, but this game has always stayed with me. I had a really hard time putting this game down. Steve Meretzky has some input on this one as well. I feel they really leaned hard into the _interactive fiction_ aspect. There are certainly challenging puzzles, but if you read and take notes nothing should be too incredibly difficult. I relied on the official hint book, as well as a walkthrough at times when I was just stuck.
    
    Really awesome experience! Would recommend.

A lot of the games I've played on this list are thanks to his hard work. It seems like I'd heard him mention _Grassy Knoll_ in passing, or maybe I read about it on his website. It was a bit of a surprise to log in to the macsourceports discord after a few weeks and see he'd just released a "Director's Cut" of the original version of the game he made in 1995. Since I've been on a bit of an IF kick, I thought I'd give it a whirl. I ended up streaming it, and he joined in for some helpful commentary. How fun could a "JFK Assasination Simulator" be? Well, it's more like historical interactive non-fiction than anything. He's recreated a few key buildings and details about the Dallas area where the unfortunate tragedy occurred. It's a bit _observational_, like _A Mind Forever Voyaging_. The point of the game is to just kind of look at things. There are some dynamic gameplay elements, like following Oswald's trail out of the Book Depot. Overall, it was an insightful little journey through something I know embarrassingly little about. Thanks, Tom!

It's not always obvious who is buying and selling. I had a fun and quick time with the game! And shoutout to Spatterlight for macOS. Super sleek and customizable IF parser. Knowing that there's a parse this good out there makes me very excited to keep playing more IF.

This was a total blast! It actually reminds me a lot of the good parts of the sidescrolling parts of the _Mystical Ninja_ games I played earlier. On top of that is a really quite compelling 2D fighter. As you progress through the game, you slowly gain abilities and upgrades. The final boss fight against Piccolo was challenging but not overly so. I'm trying to get my friend Pacheco to play it also so we can go head to head over link cable!

  text: My friend had this one growing up. I remember it being cool and fun. After my friend Carter hooked me up with one of them new-fangled N64 Switch Online controllers, I decided to give it a go with it! I really like this game! The racing is fast paced! Apparently this was developed as a Need For Speed title and then switched to a VW Beetle tie-in game, inexplicably. Fun fact! This game was released in Australia as "HSV Adventure Racing" and "HSV" is a brand of Australian cars. There are 4 circuits, and unlike Mario Kart, you'll be re-playing the levels from the previous circuits, only faster. Each time you complete a circuit, the next circuit unlocks which has you then play through all previous levels with the addition of one more. So by the end of the game, you'll be kind of sick of the first level, but you'll also need to rely on all the random tricks and shortcuts you've found along the way. Because the levels are so long and dense, there are many opportunities to find secret passages and shortcuts. The levels seems to be pretty balanced as well, unlike the shortcut in Wario Stadium for example. It's just how you'd like to do it, which made local multiplayer really fun. Trying to steal secrets from each other was a blast. The soundtrack is a nice drum and bass track and the announcer sounds fantastic. It's a great racing game!

The slightly bitcrushed sound tickles some deep synapse in my soul. I picked this one up brand new from a Walgreen's in maybe 2015 at a time when I certainly had much better things to spend my limited income on. I'm not ashamed to admit that until now I'd never actually played it. I just know it's a good game for me so I've been hanging on to it. I haven't had such a huge smile on my face in quite some time. I beat the main campaign but there's still a ton of post-game content. It's mostly just slight variations on the base rhythm games, but more of a good thing is, well, a good thing! I hope to keep plugging away on this one as time permits. The only issue - my kids want to play whenever they hear the DS open. They are horrible at it, I make it look easy I guess, but we still have "fun".

  text: Look... we had _Starfox 64_ growing up. In fact, my own late father once described his greatest life accomplishment in beating my older brother at _Starfox_. I had a lot of fun running through the short campaign. How many of us have been totally frustrated by the "protect the idiot party member" sections of an otherwise decent game? In Starfox 64, you have not only one idiot party member, but three! Slippy, the cute childish frog that seems to be completely unable to help himself stay out of harm's way. Peppy, the boomer-ish bunny that is equally hapless. And Falco... Falco... How do we deal with his _constant_ insults and sarcastic attitude? Do we just take him out deliberately? Personally, I feel bad when I let a party member down. But I also am not good enough at games to keep them alive. This game stresses me out. I didn't find this 3DS port to be particularly impressive and most of the time struggled to get it to even shoot in the right direction. Struggling against controls does not a good time make. Look, I'm glad that this 3DS port exists. I'm glad Nintendo finally re-released it as part of the classics collection since it was out of print for a long time. It just didn't translate super well for me. I like Starfox, and this gave me a hankering to play Starfox Adventures. I churned through the short campaign on "3DS" mode and that didn't leave me with much of a desire to ever pick it back up. I guess the lesson learned is don't make your antagonists more sympathetic to the player than the protagonists. I'd rather have my party die and leave me alone than try to constantly stop the incredibly weak enemies from absolutely destroying Slippy. Plus, if they die, then you don't have to listen to them any more. Bring back the SNES style bloop bloop voice acting. I'd kind of like to make a romhack that replaces the voice acting with the most insulting and annoying lines of all time.

Hirokazu (Hip) Tanaka's soundtrack is bar-none. Lore drop - while I haven't officially met Tanakasan, I have seen him in real life and could have said hello if I had something intelligent to say to him. I especially love _Overworld BGM 2_. I made up some words to it - "Everything, is going to be okay. And everything, is going to be just fine. And everything is going to go my way. And everything is going to beeeeeee juuuussst greeeaaat now!" I love the insane diversity of the worlds, unlike pretty much anything we've seen in another mainline Mario game. Aliens? Easter Island? Pyramids? I love it all! The submarine and airplane stages are an excellent break from the normal platforming. This has to be one of my favorite games of all time. It's tricky, but extra lives are plentiful so you should be able to get through it without too much trouble. Thanks, Nintnedo and Mr. Tanaka!

  text: |
    If my memory serves, it was Christmas 2001 that my brothers and I received a copy of _Sega Smash Pack Vol. 1_ for our Dreamcast. The summer before, we'd sold off a bunch of our systems, pooled our money, and saved up to buy a used Dreamcast from Software Etc. Ill-fated as the console may have been, I personally loved the Dreamcast and to this day I think it's my favorite video game console of all time. I just _love_ the Dreamcast. Everything about it. We had owned a Super Nintendo, but my experience with the Genesis was mostly just passing. Other kids had them, I thought the controller was strange but I liked the unique sounds and graphics compared to the SNES, Game Boy, and PC.

    To be honest, I found most of the games on _Smash Pack_ mid at best. _Streets of Rage 2_ ("Streets of Agence" as my younger brother called it) was particularly fun to play. _Golden Axe_, _Altered Beast_, and _Wrestle War_... not so much. However, one of the games that caught my "video game expert" older brother was Shining Force. I remember watching him play through the first missions, fascinated with the various party members who would join you, seemingly at random. It was fun to watch and offer my fledgling strategy advice during battles. That Christmas, my mom helped us convert our garage into a temporary "game room" (probably just to keep us out of her hair) but man, I fondly remember the gentle sunlight streaming in during the realtively warm winter days of Southern Utah Christmas. I don't recall how far he made it through the game, but I seem to recall that he eventually rage quit out of frustration. Still, I always remembered _Shining Force_ as a curious and inviting Sega game.

    I have a confession to make: I suck at video games. My attention span is almost zilch. I get distracted, bored, then end up doing something else and by the time I want to revisit, I can't remember where I left off or what to do. I'm honestly not sure if I've ever actually beaten an RPG that wasn't Pokémon. However, about a year ago I sunk a decent amount of time into the PS2 remake of Phantasy Star titled _Phantasy Star Generation 1_. I gained an appreciation and understanding of the non-Nintendo/Square/Enix JRPG heritage. They just play differently and in my opinion, different in a good way. Shining Force is certainly no exception.

    _Shining Force_ is _incredible_. It's hard for me to put into words _why_ I like this game so much. It reminds me a lot of the early Pokémon games in the way that you play through with mostly a small-ish party, but there's still plenty of other characters for you to familiarize yourself and form strategies around for future playthroughs. Most of the party members in _Shining Force_, like Pokémon, are optional. I'm generally pretty thourough but I still didn't even find all of them during my playthrough! The game is incredibly balanced, the enemy AI adapts to your specific party and play style. It's challenging but incredibly forgiving! The hero of your party, Max, has a spell that will instantly teleport you from the battle back to the last Priest you visited to resurrect and heal your party. All experience is kept, so even if you fail and have to retreat or die, the game rewards you for even trying since when you attempt the battle again, your party will be a little stronger! I did a bit of "grinding" to level up party members if I found a battle to be a bit too difficult or if party members kept dying, but it doesn't really feel like grinding in the typical JRPG sense since the enemy AI will adapt to your new stronger party. No two battles will ever go _exactly_ the same way! It's a bit like chess in that sense.

    As usual, I cheated by using a single save state (mostly to eliminate mistakes and random number pitfalls), and made heavy use of fast-forward to help with my lack of patience. Even still, my experience with _Shining Force_ was absolutely incredible. This is a strong contender for my _Game of the Year_, and possibly even my favorite game of all time. There are no tutorials. No exposition. No insane story and opaque directions. It's incredibly linear. It plays almost like a book. But with the variability in party members and stats, I could see how people would play this game again and again. There are some rough spots when it comes to inventory management and party management. My choices were mostly "vibes" based, just seeing which members seemed to do well in battle versus those who just totally sucked. If you ask 10 people how they play this game, you'll probably get 10 different answers and to me, that's what makes a game fun. I don't think they expected you to buy the strategy guide and call a 1-800 help line like _cough_ Nintendo _cough_ did at that time. They simply made a great game that's fun to play.

  text: |
    After having a complete and total _blast_ with Shining Force, I knew I wanted to play another game. I had a hard time deciding diving straight into _Shining Force II_ or sticking with the timeline of the games and going with _Final Conflict_. Obviously, I went with _Final Conflict_. There are actually a total of 3 _Shining Force_ games released for the Game Gear and if the other two are anywhere near as good as _Final Conflict_, they're easily in the top 3 best games released for the Game Gear. Too bad nobody would have been able to actually _see_ the dang game on actual Game Gear hardware back in 1995! It really is too bad because this is possibly one of the best 8-bit RPGs on any system ever released. I like to imagine an alternate timeline when the white LED was invented in the late 80's, which would have enabled the Game Gear to have a display that is actually legible. Oh well.

    _Final Conflict_ takes place in between the first and second _Shining Force_ games on the Genesis. To be honest, any connections to the first game are mostly irrelevant. The only characters from the first game that appear are Adam, the useless robot who is actually unplayable but becomes a combined tactician and priest (he heals your fallen party members); Mishaela, Darksol's evil magician lady who's kind of a mini-boss in the first game; and (spoiler alert) Max, the lead from the first game who's fallen under Mishaela's spell. Other than that, I'm not aware of any people or locations that are related to the first game. All that to say that if you're playing this for the overall _Shining_ story, it's not really necessary.

    That said, as an 8-bit tactical RPG, _Final Conflict_ is pretty good! There are absolutely no overworld exploration sections. Most of the time between battles Adam will just ask you if you want to save and allow you to raise fallen members. Occasionally you'll go to a town which consists of Adam and his normal abilities, and a shop where you can upgrade your weapons and buy healing items. Some of the major annoyances with inventory managment are actually solved here by simple means like asking if you'd like to immediately equip a new item and the ability to quickly see what everyone is currently holding instead of diving through the same menu a thousand times. That was a welcome improvement! Due to the Game Gear's limited screen resolution, a decent chunk of the battle map will be taken up by title text but simply holding START hides it! You'll be holding START a lot if you want to know where you're going!

    Compared with _Shining Force_, _Final Conflict_ felt slightly uninspired. Two maps stand out though. The first being a bridge you have to cross while it's falling apart by an evil giant squid that will also completely wreck you if you stay near the edge of the water. The second to last map has you ascending a giant tower with 5 statues that will continually rain hellfire down on your party while also getting completely pwned by flying magic creatures giant area of effect spells. Seriously, I almost rage quit on this mission and had to go through several times before I eventually loaded everyone up with as many healing items as I could. Further complicated is the fact that the final battle against the same 3-headed (well, two handed and single-headed in this case) dragon as the first game will fully heal any of your party members but _will not raise them_. This means that if most of your party dies in the lead-up, you're stuck with whoever is left. The first time I beat the second to last mission I ended up with only two party members which left the final mission impossible. Usually you can simply egress back to town to heal up and jump right back in, but in this case doing so will boot you back to the tower of hellfire doom! So you _really_ have to be careful to not leave yourself with no remaining party members! Once I was able to do this, the final boss was a total cakewalk. The other issue I had is that many of the maps make use of "suprise" attacks where a bunch of random enemies will pop up half way through the map and totally wreck your tactics. Even still, they aren't too hard, it just kind of left a sour taste in my mouth each time my carefully planned out team layout would just get completely turned upside down by a random magic user casting some spell that nailed 4 of my party with massive damage. Melee and ranged enemies are no problem but man, the enemy magic is seriously overpowered! I had less of a problem deciding which party members to take with me and which to leave on the bench because there's less party members overall and the ones I left benched basically completely sucked. For these reasons, I feel that there's significantly less _depth_ in this game than the mainline entry, but for an on-the-go "side story", I still had quite a bit of time with the battles!

    Overall, _Shining Force Gaiden: Final Conflict_ is a fun and impressive game for yet another ill-fated Sega console and it's too bad we didn't get an official release in the US. Thanks to the folks at _Shining Force Central_ for the fan translation!

    I first played _EarthBound_ on my brother's PC using SNES9x in about 2002 after becoming familiarized with _Ness_ in Super Smash Bros. I found the game to be very difficult, yet appealing. For some reason the typical high fantasy setting of most RPGs never really struck a chord with me. But this strange game set in modern day America, complete with an odd but interesting soundtrack, was quite intriguing to me.

    A few years later I ended up with a Dell Pocket PC and it could run NES games quite well despite the horrific ergonomics. Somehow I came accross the unreleased original "Earth Bound" game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, known at that time as "EarthBound Zero". I can remember getting to the factory level and being quite overwhelmed, but still the game was intriguing.

    In October 2008 I was in my senior year of High School. I had a friend's PSP I was "borrowing" and liked to play random games on. The fan translation for the long rumoured "EarthBound 2" finally came out. That was my introduction to _Mother 3_. I have a clear memory of playing it on my PSP while waiting in the school parking lot for my friend to finish basketball practice. It had everything I loved about the other two _Mother_ games with a modern layer of polish and refinement that made playing it a pleasant experience. I never actually beat the game at that time, but I enjoyed the time I spent with it.

    Over the years I've participated in _Mother 3_ fandom by keeping it around to play, organizing group reproduction buys (before the days of cheap bootleg carts flooding eBay), trying it out on various emulators, and generally just keeping the game on my radar, hopeful for an eventual official release. There's been several times I've nearly decided to finally give it an earnest shot again, and a couple of times I've attempted it only to become frustrated or distracted by life. That's right, up until now I'd never actually beaten _Mother 3_.

    I'm not sure what made me decide now was the time, but roughly 17 years to the day from the fan translation being released, I decided to give it another shot.

    _Mother 3_ is an absolute treasure. The story for the most part is incredibly linear, playing more like a book or movie than a true video game. I like this in games. I don't like not knowing what I'm supposed to be doing and not knowing the little sequence break tips and tricks experienced players know. I also don't have the time or patience to figure it all out on my own, and I feel like a cheater when I use a walkthrough, it just takes away the wonder and excitement. _Mother 3_ fits that niche perfectly for me. It's excellently paced, broken up into chapters that just seem to be the right length to keep it fresh.

    The game is genuinely hilarious! One thing I like is that the overall cast of characters is small, maybe only 50 or so NPCs you'd actually interact with. Because of this, you're able to watch them all grow and change throughout the game. It's not just town after town filled with endless people who usually but not always have nothing helpful to tell you. Each time you see an NPC you can expect they'll have something unique, novel, and usually pretty funny to say to you.

    As usual, I cheat by playing with a single save state and fast-forward. I generally "suck" at video games, so using a single quick save buys me a lot of peace of mind knowing I won't mess anything up too bad. Occasionally I'll use more save states when starting a big battle but that was rare in this instance. Fast-forward makes the occasional grind less of a bother.

    _Mother 3_ is a masterpiece. It's my favorite in the series by far, and likely one of my favorite games of all time. I just get it; it gets me. I'd like to personally thank Itoi-san and everyone else who was involved in it's creation. I'm glad they took the time it needed to get it just right. If you've never played it, there's never been a better time than now!
