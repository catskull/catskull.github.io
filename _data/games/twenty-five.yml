  text: I'm not sure how I came across this game, but boy, I'm glad I did. I'm not really familiar with the whole [Chris Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Roberts_(video_game_developer))-verse and have never played any _Wing Commander_ games. I've been more-or-less obsessed with the entire "space cowboy" concept for about as long as I can remember. Why is it so gripping? _Freelancer_ is everything I've ever wanted out of a "space game". Here's the thing about outer space - it's mostly empty, which is also pretty boring. A lot of "space games" get caught up trying to work around this since your options are to make it boring or unlrealistic. _Freelancer_ has a very basic gameplay loop – land on planet, get job, go into space, do job (usually in the form of flying to a specific place and shooting a group of bad guys), earn money, upgrade ship, repeat. At face value, it's boring and repetitive. However, the actual space combat itself is just so well done and engaging that it's really actually addicting. The game also does a fantastic job with some really well done voice acting and cutscene work, well ahead of it's time. Unfortunately this game is mostly lost to obscurity and you can't even buy it anymore. Despite that, there is a passionate community of players and mods in the [_Discovery_](https://discoverygc.com) scene, but I haven't gotten into that yet. Honestly, I want to just play the main campaign again and take my time with it. By the way – how was this game not on the original Xbox? I _yearn_ for an alternate past where this game launched on Xbox Live in 2003. It would have been incredible.
