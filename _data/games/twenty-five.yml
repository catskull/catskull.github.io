  text: I'm not sure how I came across this game, but boy, I'm glad I did. I'm not really familiar with the whole [Chris Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Roberts_(video_game_developer))-verse and have never played any _Wing Commander_ games. I've been more-or-less obsessed with the entire "space cowboy" concept for about as long as I can remember. Why is it so gripping? _Freelancer_ is everything I've ever wanted out of a "space game". Here's the thing about outer space - it's mostly empty, which is also pretty boring. A lot of "space games" get caught up trying to work around this since your options are to make it boring or unlrealistic. _Freelancer_ has a very basic gameplay loop – land on planet, get job, go into space, do job (usually in the form of flying to a specific place and shooting a group of bad guys), earn money, upgrade ship, repeat. At face value, it's boring and repetitive. However, the actual space combat itself is just so well done and engaging that it's really actually addicting. The game also does a fantastic job with some really well done voice acting and cutscene work, well ahead of it's time. Unfortunately this game is mostly lost to obscurity and you can't even buy it anymore. Despite that, there is a passionate community of players and mods in the [_Discovery_](https://discoverygc.com) scene, but I haven't gotten into that yet. Honestly, I want to just play the main campaign again and take my time with it. By the way – how was this game not on the original Xbox? I _yearn_ for an alternate past where this game launched on Xbox Live in 2003. It would have been incredible.

  text: I've never played any of the _Half-Life_ games. The only Valve game I know that I've played is _Portal_. I decided I'd find out what the fuss was about. Officially, there's no way to play the original _Half-Life_ on Mac without emulation. Fortunately, [MacSourcePorts](https://www.macsourceports.com/game/halflife) has a version available. It's using a project called [xash3d-fwgs](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs), an open-source implementation of the original _Half-Life_ engine (GoldSrc). Playing at 75hz on my little 4:3 SyncMaster LCD is quite engrossing and feels very authentic. It's probably not fully fair to put _Uplink_ on this list, but I'm doing it anyways. _Uplink_ is a HL demo that has a small standalone campaign. It used to be very obscure, but Valve included it in the Anniversary release of _Half-Life_ so everyone can play it. It really is a great little preview of the full game and is probably worth playing through before starting the campaign if nothing else as an extended tutorial as I found the difficulty to be a lot lower.

    Here's some raw output from my notes:
    - robot voice sounds awesome (kraftwerk)
    - screaming butthole dogs?
    - gonarch
    - "Just keep shooting at the B A L L"
    - helicopter is way annoying
    I have a theory - first-person shooters should not have a jump mechanism. I can totally see why Counter-Strike took off in a way that Half-Life didn't as much - the combat and shooting is _so tight_ and the AI is actually pretty fun. There's human soldiers and aliens (butthole pigs) trying to kill you, so you have to keep shaking up your weapon of choice and strategy. Ammo runs pretty low usually so get comfortable with all the weapons. It's not without it's flaws but overall Half-Life was pretty fun, cursed biology notwithstanding. Seriously, jumping into the three-armed baby's head and shooting it's floating electric orb brain until it dies. I'm excited to continue the Half-Life-verse.

  text: I admit I did get _Blue Shift_ running on my Dreamcast at some point and made it far enough that the save file eventually exceeded the size of the total VMU capacity and it wouldn't let me continue. I don't remember much as I didn't get far. This is a pretty weak expansion overall. It's fine but offers no real "new" content beyond just more of the same thing you got in _Half-Life_ and it actually doesn't even have all of the weapons (unless I missed something). The entire end sequence with draining a coolant pool, moving barrels to jump on, filling it back up and beyond is just kind of not fun. The end sequence in particular is really weak, just listening to some NPC do some random stuff off-screen. And at the end they just... drive away? It feels like the "best parts" of this game are supposed to be little glimpses of the Gordon Freeman storyline but it's not enough to keep me going. Play if you love Half-Life but don't feel bad if you skip this one.

And then the credit song. I'm not going to lie, I sat in my office and sobbed. It's just such a fun game and a pleasant experience. GlaDOS feels like as much of antagonist to the test subject as the game itself is to me. Provocative yet irritatingly engaging. Good one for kids too!

It's hard to describe - like a dig dug metroidvania. Overall the graphics, sound, story, and music are mostly forgettable , aside from one surprising "glitch in the matrix" event. I really enjoyed this game and it's improved on the original in pretty much every way, so if you haven't played either you're safe to jump right into the sequel. Highly recommended!

  text: After I beat the original _SteamWorld Dig_ in 2015, I was excited to see the next game in the series. I was initially very turned off by _SteamWorld Heist_. It's a 2D turn-based strategy platformer. Image & Form really know how to innovate on some existing game styles, and they do it very well. It's mission based and the maps are somewhat randomly generated. Enough that if you die or give up, you get something that's not exactly the same the next time. It also means sometimes you just get a bad dice roll and things go south. The only real penalty is your money (gallons of water because they are robots that run on steam) and money isn't really that useful. The game will give you new gear and weapons to use and my strategy was to use the new weapons. It's class-based, so you recruit a team of specialists. Before each mission, you'll select 1, 2, 3, or 4 members of your team and load them out with gear and weapons. Team members are rewarded in experience points and will unlock new abilites that make your life easier. For this reason, you end up a bit with the Pokémon issue of only levelling up your favorite members of your party. It's not all bad, I found bundling an under-leveled team member in with more experienced members worked out just fine. And you can always go back and re-play old missions with new team members. I got pretty addicted and it was a little frustrating. I played through on the normal difficulty but had to drop down to easy for the sub-boss fight that was just insane.

  text: Silicon & Synapse started in the late 80's as a contract studio to port other games. It's a solid business plan and one that is still pretty lucrative if you're good at your target platforms. _The Lost Vikings_ was their first original IP and is a real-time team-based puzzle-platformer. Kind of like Lemmings, but you have three Vikings. Each Viking has a set of unique abilities - one can jump and run, one can fight, one can block and use a shield as a parasail. There's fall damage like no tomorrow. Each level is basically a unique puzzle. The game is split into "worlds" and each world has a few levels. The music is so much better than it has any right to be, and this was pretty early in the SNES lifecycle as well. The gameplay is just fun! The levels are designed extremely well. I had to use the hint book a few times, and as always I make heavy use of save states. With those handicaps, it was an enjoyable experience.

  text: So the first game was some random company and the second game was... _Blizzard_? As in _the_ Blizzard? Yes! Almost immediately after _The Lost Vikings_, they changed their name to _Blizzard Entertainment_. And then Warcraft, Warcraft II, and Diablo happened. Not to mention StarCraft a year later. Those are three of the absolute best and most popular games of the 90's. Blizzard was on fire! I assume The Lost Vikings 2 was in development/planning for a while and then Warcraft was such a huge surprise hit that it took a while for it to get the right people on the project and by the time they did, the N64 was already out and frankly Blizzard had better stuff to do. But apprently Interplay was happy to publish it to mediocre sales which is unfortunate, because this is a true sequel to an already great game. Difficulty and puzzle-wise, it picks right up where the first game left off. Each Viking how has some additional abilities (runner has jetpack boots and can swim, fighter has a robot arm to swing around, shield guy can... fart). They also added a werewolf and a dragon. The wolf can wall jump and melee attach. The dragon can fly and shoot fire balls. You still only play with 3 at a time, they just swap in and out at random. This one felt shorter than the first, but not too short. The final boss is quite a bit more spread out in this game. I should also mention that there is a PS1 port of this game that's exactly the same game gameplay-wise, but literally all the graphics and assets are different including full voice acting that's not bad! It wasn't developed by Blizzard so I opted for the SNES version, but this isn't a bad option at all!

   On September 20, 2019 I walked into a Bic Camera in Tokyo, Japan and bought a copy of "The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening" and a grey Switch Lite, both of which had been released that day. While I enjoy the remaster, I was disappointed by it's poor performance and overall felt the gameplay was lacking some of the charm that made the original and it's re-release so appealing. I'm sure it's likely due to a healthy dose of nostalgia. I remember playing, and enjoying, Link's Awakening as a kid growing up in the 90's. I owned a Game Boy but not this game, so I was relegated to quick play sessions at a friend's house. I appreciated multiple save files - usually there was a free space for me to save my game. I never made it very far, but the entire intro sequence was just so unassuming yet inviting to me. Later I remember borrowing the DX release from my older brother's friend and getting maybe half way before losing interest or having to give it back. I'm pretty sure Link's Awakening was my intro to the Zelda franchise. Later we'd own Ocerena of Time and Windwaker, but those are other stories. The game holds up pretty well. I played with the ["redux" romhack](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/4672/) which just tweaks a few very minor inconveniences. Still, the copious amount of back tracking did get old. Thankfully, the game doesn't overstay it's welcome. By the final dungeon, I was pretty much done with the persistant menuing to get items equipped. But then, it ended! I beat it! I liked Link's Awakening then, and I like it now. As a kid it was just a game I could pick up and play even if I didn't know what to do. My kids agree, letting them take a turn for a few minutes hacking away at baddies and grass is easy and smooth.

  text: Another entry in the "it was on the family computer growing up". I played this one a lot growing up. The completely unforgiving platforming, combined with the extremely forgiving and quick resets makes this a very good game to suck at. Indeed, my 4 year old took over half way through this one, including the combat. As always I made copious use of save states to get through each section flawlessly, but it really doesn't detract at all from the game. The platforming is _fun_. Really fun. The low quality rotoscoped animations have aged like fine wine and look even better today than ever. The platforming is somewhat slow and deliberate, as any "cinematic platformer" (as they'd later come to be called) should be. _Prince of Persia_ is an inviting and forgiving game to play for all ages and I'd highly recommend you give it a shot. It was also ported to pretty much every console around, and I'm sure those ports are all fine. Just give it a whirl!

  text: It's a bit difficult to try and make sense of the early Blizzard Entertainment timeline. After 1993's "The Lost Vikings", the gang followed up with a another fresh IP - Blackthorne. The story is mostly unimportant and forgettable, but I did pick up on the same root ideas that would clearly later influence both Warcraft and Diablo to some extent in both theme and art style. Diving straight into Blackthorne after TLV, it's clear to see how similar the games really are which is when I realized that The Lost Vikings is also _technically_ a "cinematic platformer" as well. Following on the major success of _Prince of Persia_, _Flashback_, and _Another World_, Blizzard fired up the Lost Vikings' engine and cranked out a cinematic platformer of their own. As always copious save states made the game quicker and more enjoyable. The game is broken into levels with a few different "areas" where the graphics will change. Progression usually looks like moving from the entrance to the exit, solving various platforming puzzles along the way such as finding key items or accessing hard to reach locations. The level design is really good, flows naturally and I rarely had to rely on a guide or walkthrough. A staple of the "cinematic platformer" genre is combat sequence breaks. Kind of like a 2D Time Crisis if you're played that arcade classic - take cover, shoot, take cover. The combat isn't anywhere as engaging or smooth as _Prince of Persia_, but shooting the gun is fun and you're treated with decent upgrades along the way to keep the gameplay fresh. Like the other Blizzard games on this list, it packs in just the right amount of content to feel like you had an opportunity to really nail the platforming without going on longer than it needs to.

    "It was on the family computer growing up". I actually later personally bought the SNES port after that computer had fallen out of repair because I liked it. This game has captivated me for a long time. It came out in 1991 which was the year I was born and it was on our computer from the time I can remember. Playing this game with my Dad is one of my earliest and most distinct memories. Have you ever seen anything like this before, or since? I haven't really. Artist, programmer, and overall genius Éric Chahi previously worked on _Future Wars_ which I played through last year. Chahi implemented the game as a virtual machine with all vector graphics which is why it was ported so easily and mostly very well to pretty much every system. Are you getting the picture yet? If you make a game that runs on literally everything, you'll sell a lot more copies! After a Grammy-worthy opening cinematic, you're teleported to the bottom of a giant pool of water. As you swim to the surface, some form of alien tentacle begins to reach for your kicking legs. As you climb out just in time, you're greated with a bleak alien landscape. Something moves behind you. Welcome to Another World! The game almost plays like an interactive story book. The puzzles are challenging yet rewarding. I'm truly filled with a sense of wonder as I'm taken through the game's story, each new environment more unique and interesting than the last. This is worth spending a few minutes of your time with!

As a kid, I liked the art and voices. I understood the basics of RTS gameplay but likely never made it much past the first few missions. Just like then, I made it to the first cave level for the Orc campaign and decided I'd rather cheat my way through than deal with the poor unit command options. The possibility of complex unit command structures is there, but the UI just make it so incredibly difficult. I think it's 100% beatable as-is. I just ran out of steam brute-forcing it. Cheating my way through the rest of the Orc and the Human campaigns was actually pretty fun! It's fun to see the misssions as the story and map unfold on both sides. The voice acting is really good, and the art is fun and chunky. I think Dune II is a better RTS overall, but Warcraft proves once again Blizzard knew how to make a compelling entry into an (at the time) uncommon genre.

    _Katamari Damacy Rolling LIVE_ is the first new mainline entry into the _Katamari_ series since 2011's mobile-exclusive "Touch My Katamari". I think _Rolling LIVE_ is overlooked as another mobile exclusive, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. The game boasts 4K 120fps support on all the Apple platforms that support it. It's not some watered-down mobile port. It's a full-fledged entry into the series! In my opinion, this is the best _Katamari_ game yet. It has you helping The King collaborate with "streamers" to build your streaming channel. The "streamers" are random people with specific requests, from a man in an eating contest asking you to roll him into as much food as possible, to an Alien wanting you to roll up the entire world. I think the live-streaming aspect of the game is an extremely original take on the series that just makes the game more fun to play without actually changing any of the core gameplay. In fact, if anything, it helps make a bit more sense of the story. Rolling up everything in sight while beeing cheered on by your chat is just such a pleasant experience. The soundtrack is _phenominal_, and you can listen it on all streaming platforms. My favorite track is the blissfully cheery "Making a Star" which serves as the perfect juxtaposition for rolling up screaming and kicking people into your Katamari.

I intend to keep buying and playing, and talking about Katamari until the air leaves my chest for the final time. I like to consider _Katamari_ literally. What if you were sitting in your living room, and a little cool dude came rolling a ball through? At first, it's fine because it's just like crumbs and other stuff. But then he comes through again, and dang it he just stole your shoe. Finally, he comes through and rolls YOU up. But here's the thing: it's not a problem! Getting rolled up by a _Katamari_ is literally the best-case scenario for your life!
    <br>
    I'd like to thank Bandai Namco for developing this game, and Apple Arcade for releasing it to the masses. I think everyone should play this game from ages 1 to 100. It's universal.
