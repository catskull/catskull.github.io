    Bomberman Hero is a platforming video game and the second Bomberman game for the Nintendo 64. A further departure from the 16-bit Bomberman titles after Bomberman 64, it gives Bomberman more character moves, and features additional levels, bosses, and weapons. However, in a break from the Bomberman series formula, it lacks a multiplayer mode. This game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console service in 2011.
