    Bomberman Hero is a platforming video game and the second Bomberman game for the Nintendo 64. A further departure from the 16-bit Bomberman titles after Bomberman 64, it gives Bomberman more character moves, and features additional levels, bosses, and weapons. However, in a break from the Bomberman series formula, it lacks a multiplayer mode. This game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console service in 2011.

    Philosophical question of how to distinguish between science and non-science
  extract: |
    In philosophy of science and epistemology, the demarcation problem is the question of how to distinguish between science and non-science. It also examines the boundaries between science, pseudoscience and other products of human activity, like art and literature and beliefs. The debate continues after more than two millennia of dialogue among philosophers of science and scientists in various fields. The debate has consequences for what can be termed "scientific" in topics such as education and public policy.
