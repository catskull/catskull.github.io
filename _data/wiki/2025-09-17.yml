    1995 video game
  extract: |
    Vectorman is a 2D action platformer video game developed by BlueSky Software and published by Sega. The game was released for the Sega Genesis in late 1995 in North America and Europe. It was considered a critical and commercial success, achieving its dual goal of retaining interest in the aging Sega Genesis platform in face of the increasingly popular new technology of the next generation of video game consoles and providing competition to industry competitor Nintendo's popular Donkey Kong Country video game. In subsequent decades, the game was re-released across many Sega-themed video game compilations, and on its own across the Wii Virtual Console, Steam, Sega Forever, and Nintendo Classics digital platforms. A sequel, Vectorman 2, was released in 1996, but despite several abandoned attempts at making a Vectorman 3, no further games have been released.
