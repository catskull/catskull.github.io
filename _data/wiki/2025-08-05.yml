    Label sizes used for garments sold off-the-shelf
  extract: |
    Clothing sizes are the sizes with which garments sold off-the-shelf are labeled. Sizing systems vary based on the country and the type of garment, such as dresses, tops, skirts, and trousers. There are three approaches:Body dimensions: The label states the range of body measurements for which the product was designed. 
    Product dimensions: The label states characteristic dimensions of the product. 
    Ad hoc sizes: The label states a size number or code with no obvious relationship to any measurement. Children's clothes sizes are sometimes described by the age of the child, or, for infants, the weight.

    Mass-produced clothing in standard sizes
  extract: |
    Ready-to-wear (RTW) – also called prêt-à-porter, or off-the-rack or off-the-peg in casual use – is the term for garments sold in finished condition in standardized sizes, as distinct from made-to-measure or bespoke clothing tailored to a particular person's frame. In other words, it is a piece of clothing that was mass produced in different sizes and sold that way instead of it being designed and sewn for one person. The term off-the-peg is sometimes used for items other than clothing, such as handbags. It is the opposite of haute couture.
