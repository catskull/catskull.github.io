    Label sizes used for garments sold off-the-shelf
  extract: |
    Clothing sizes are the sizes with which garments sold off-the-shelf are labeled. Sizing systems vary based on the country and the type of garment, such as dresses, tops, skirts, and trousers. There are three approaches:Body dimensions: The label states the range of body measurements for which the product was designed. 
    Product dimensions: The label states characteristic dimensions of the product. 
    Ad hoc sizes: The label states a size number or code with no obvious relationship to any measurement. Children's clothes sizes are sometimes described by the age of the child, or, for infants, the weight.
