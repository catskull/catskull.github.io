    A cliché used as a pattern for other expressions
  extract: |
    A snowclone is a clichéd phrase in which one or more words can be substituted to express a similar idea in a different context, often to humorous or sarcastic effect. For example, the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's phrase "the mother of all battles" has spawned such variations as "the mother of all pizzas." The term snowclone was coined in 2004, derived from journalistic clichés that referred to the number of Inuit words for snow.
