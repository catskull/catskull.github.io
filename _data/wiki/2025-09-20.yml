    Plan 9 from Bell Labs is an operating system designed by the Computing Science Research Center (CSRC) at Bell Labs in the mid-1980s, built on the UNIX concepts first developed there in the late 1960s. Since 2000, Plan 9 has been free and open-source. The final official release was in early 2015.
