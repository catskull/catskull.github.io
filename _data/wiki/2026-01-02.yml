    1988 single by Brian Wilson
  extract: |
    "Love and Mercy" is a song by the American musician Brian Wilson and the opening track from his 1988 album Brian Wilson. Co-produced by Russ Titelman, the song was released as a single on July 1, 1988, but failed to chart. Psychologist Eugene Landy and his girlfriend Alexandra Morgan were formerly listed as co-writers. Wilson characterized "Love and Mercy" as a semi-autobiographical song that exemplifies his own "Jesus Christ complex," or in other words, his compulsion to "give love to people". The song was influenced by the 1965 hit "What the World Needs Now Is Love."
