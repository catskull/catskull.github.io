    Apparatus for trapping and cooling neutral atoms
  extract: |
    In atomic, molecular, and optical physics, a magneto-optical trap (MOT) is an apparatus which uses laser cooling and a spatially varying magnetic field to create a trap which can produce samples of cold neutral atoms. Temperatures achieved in a MOT can be as low as several microkelvins, depending on the atomic species, which is two or three times below the photon-recoil limit. However, for atoms with an unresolved hyperfine structure, such as 7Li, the temperature achieved in a MOT will be higher than the Doppler cooling limit.
