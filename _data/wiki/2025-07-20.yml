    Desert Storm trading cards are sets of trading cards that feature people and equipment involved in the Gulf War. The cards were published in the United States by various companies and the size of sets varied greatly in between companies. The cards were claimed to be educational, with proceeds of the sales benefiting the children of Persian Gulf War veterans, and were produced at a time when the trading card industry was expanding its range well outside of the traditional sports figures. 
    These sets were fairly popular in 1991 and each box used by retailers included 36 Packs.
