    2025 Internet meme
  extract: |
    6-7 is an internet meme and slang term that emerged in early 2025 on TikTok and Instagram Reels. The phrase originated from the song "Doot Doot " by Skrilla, which became popular in video edits featuring professional basketball players, and especially LaMelo Ball who is 6 ft 7 in (2.01 meters) tall.
