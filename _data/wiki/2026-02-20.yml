  extract: |
    The Noe Valley public toilet is a public toilet in the San Francisco neighborhood Noe Valley. The toilet's original proposed cost of $1.7 million inspired media coverage and criticism of the San Francisco government. In the wake of the media coverage, the San Francisco Recreation & Parks Department, its owner, called it "the world's most famous and eagerly anticipated prefab toilet".
