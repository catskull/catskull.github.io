    Quality of being humble
  extract: |
    Humility is the quality of being humble. While older definitions, such as the 1998 Oxford Dictionary entry, described humility as having a "low opinion of oneself" or "not being proudful", more recent psychological and philosophical definitions emphasize having an "accurate opinion of oneself". This modern view includes expressing modesty appropriately, possessing clear goal orientation, openness, broad-mindedness, and a non-imposing mentality.
