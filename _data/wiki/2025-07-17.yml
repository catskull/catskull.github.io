    First detonation of a nuclear weapon
  extract: |
    Trinity was the first detonation of a nuclear weapon, conducted by the United States Army at 5:29 a.m. Mountain War Time on July 16, 1945, as part of the Manhattan Project. The test was of an implosion-design plutonium bomb, or "gadget" – the same design as the Fat Man bomb later detonated over Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945. Concerns about whether the complex Fat Man design would work led to a decision to conduct the first nuclear test. The code name "Trinity" was assigned by J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory; the name was possibly inspired by the poetry of John Donne.

    Type of sign
  extract: |
    A barber's pole is a type of sign used by barbers to signify the place or shop where they perform their craft. The trade sign is, by a tradition dating back to the Middle Ages, a staff or pole with a helix of colored stripes. The pole may be stationary or may rotate, often with the aid of an electric motor. The consistent use of this advertising symbol can be seen as analogous to an apothecary's show globe, a tobacconist's cigar store Indian and a pawn broker's three gold balls.
