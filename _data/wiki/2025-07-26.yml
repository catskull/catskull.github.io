    1967 song by the Beatles
  extract: |
    "When I'm Sixty-Four" is a song by the English rock band The Beatles, written by Paul McCartney and released on the 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It was one of the first songs McCartney wrote; he was about 14, probably in April or May 1956. The song was recorded in a different key from the final version; it was sped up at McCartney's request to make his voice sound younger. It prominently features a trio of clarinets.

    Decrease in a behavioral response to a repeated stimulus
  extract: |
    Habituation is a form of non-associative learning in which an organismâ€™s non-reinforced response to an inconsequential stimulus decreases after repeated or prolonged presentations of that stimulus. For example, organisms may habituate to repeated sudden loud noises when they learn that these have no consequences.
