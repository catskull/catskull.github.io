    In computing, a nibble, also spelled nybble to match byte, is a unit of information that is an aggregation of four-bits; half of a byte/octet. The unit is alternatively called nyble, nybl, half-byte or tetrade. In networking or telecommunications, the unit is often called a semi-octet, quadbit, or quartet.
