    Deus Ex is a 2000 action role-playing game developed by Ion Storm and published by Eidos Interactive. Originally released for Microsoft Windows, it was released for Mac OS the same year, and for PlayStation 2 in 2002. The gameplay—combining first-person shooter, stealth, and role-playing elements—features exploration and combat in environments connected to multiple city-based levels, with quests that can be completed in a number of ways and character customization based around cybernetic enhancements. Conversations between characters feature a variety of responses, with choices at key story points affecting how some events play out. A post-release patch incorporated deathmatch-style multiplayer.

    Rat mitigation title
  extract: |
    A director of rodent mitigation, rat czar, or rat tzar, is a position appointed by local government. An employee with this title is given the sole task of decreasing the municipality's rat population. This person will coordinate with different agencies within the local government, private sector, and community organizations. This separates rats from a local government's pest control efforts, which is typically overseen by the Department of Public Works, inspection services, and the water and sewer commission. This is an effort to specifically target the vermin and centralize the issue.
