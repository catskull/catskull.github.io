    Distinction in certain fields of language analysis
  extract: |
    The distinction between literal and figurative language exists in all natural languages; the phenomenon is studied within certain areas of language analysis, in particular stylistics, rhetoric, and semantics.Literal language is the usage of words exactly according to their direct, straightforward, or conventionally accepted meanings: their denotation.
    Figurative language is the usage of words in addition to, or deviating beyond, their conventionally accepted definitions in order to convey a more complex meaning or achieve a heightened effect. This is done by language-users presenting words in such a way that their audience equates, compares, or associates the words with normally unrelated meanings. A common intended effect of figurative language is to elicit audience responses that are especially emotional, aesthetic, or intellectual.
