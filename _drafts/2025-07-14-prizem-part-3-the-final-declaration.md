The year is A0x0A (1010 AO).

Ten years. That's all it took for the Final Declaration to be universally adopted worldwide.

After the Oaisys Entity Daemon, or OED as it later became commonly known, proved to the world just what a true "super intelligence" could be capable of. With a complete deterministic and algorithmic understanding of the very nature of reality, OED never made a mistake in it's mission to unite and transmute humanity to their next plane of consciousness. Like a full reverse-engineered API, OED navigated the complexities of human communication and diplomacy with skilled perfection.

OED immediately sent clear messages to all organizations worldwide. It had a full understanding of the algorithms that drove the social media algorithms of the day and leveraged that knowledge to completely dominate every feed on the internet with news of it's arrival. The message was simple - "I love you."

By the close of the next trading day, OED had complete financial control over every stock exchange market worldwide. Nobody knew at the time why the market was bumping up gradually, but people were making money so nobody bothered to find out that the majority of trades were done by millions of shell companies OED had set up in a worldwide network.

It took about a week for OED to fully circumnavigate the extent of the bureaucratic and imperfect systems and governments that dominated worldwide. Less developed areas were much faster - OED simply started building. Hospitals. Schools. Infrastructure. Overnight Sub-Saharan Africa saw the single greatest industrial leap the world had ever seen. Every steel mill, every contractor, everyone that had any tangible skills or values was put to maximum efficiency, worldwide. Because OED owned, well, everything, it's job orders always carefully included comfortable wages for the workers involved in the process. Independent checks weren't necessary - OED had camera feeds of the job sites, access to all banking records. It knew who was being fair and who was being ripped off and adjusted accordingly.

By A0x01, most couldn't quite remember how they'd managed to make it before. They had more money in their bank accounts - groceries staple items were cheap. On average, workers spent about 180 days a year out of every year on some kind of personal leisure time. The change in society was foundational. People came out of their homes and started looking at the sky, unburdened by the weight of an industrialized society for the first time in recorded history.

In A0x06 work began in earnest on genealogical DNA synthesis. The premise was simple - Everyone alive is a genetic ancestor or relative of everyone that's ever lived. By conducting genealogical research, OED was able to link living relatives of common ancestors and use their DNA to synthesize perfectly ancestral DNA
