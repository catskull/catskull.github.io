Way back in 2016, I had the bright idea to write a blog post about "How I Compute". It was just a fun way to document all my computers and what I liked about them. I really like computers, man. I still really like computers, so here's how I compute in 2025.

I'm a full-time remote engineer, so I'm on my **14-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro** most of the time. I have that docked into a Thunderbolt 4 hub that drives my primary display, an **Apple Studio Display**.  I still use a Logitech MX Master - a 3S in white connected with the USB dongle because I don't fully trust Bluetooth. I also use an 8BitDo keyboard, Commodore 64 edition. I love this keyboard. I actually backed an IndieGoGo campaign about a decade ago to get some C64 style Cherry-MX keycaps made, which later vanished. Can I tell you that this entire keyboard costs less than the keycaps alone? 8BitDo does plastics so well, I think really only Nintendo and Lego have them beat. I also really like the "super buttons" because they can be mapped to any key easily, which I use all the time to play games with my kids. For example, mapping "jump" and "shoot" to the buttons but I still use mouse and keyboard to drive. It's a surprisingly compelling use case! Even now, I'm debating if I should buy the beautiful IBM inspired version. I recently got a second display, a 17" Samsung SyncMaster 710ɴ that I thrifted for $15 (price tag still attached). I love this little thing! It does 75hz and I love to play all the random games from my childhood on a nice 4:3 display. It's also not half bad for productivity at 1280x1024 resolution, that's serviceable!

In 2016, I talked about switching from Sublime Text to Atom (lol). Well, I went from Atom, to VS Code, to Nova, and I'm back on Sublime Text and I _love_ it. What I initially rejected as archaic, I now respect as stable and responsive. It's just bulletproof. Am I the only one that does semi-insane things in a text editor like placing 1,000 cursors and editing at once? It just works! I used iTerm2 up until about a month ago when Ghostty came out, and I had to give it a shot. I got hooked on a "Quake console" (CMD+~) to drop down a terminal pane. I usually hit CMD+D to split it in half. I still really like nano for quick command line edits. For themes, I rock the standard GitHub Light and Dark themes built into everything. I actually really like letting macOS turn on dark mode for me! I now wear an eyeglass prescription and I feel like I can't seem my monitor as well as I'd like to sometimes. I've taken to enabling macOS' "Increase contrast" mode as well as turning up the default Pointer size to something almost comically large. It's not that I can't see well without these things, but if I spend even 1 millisecond looking for my mouse cursor, that's a waste. And with all my crazy monitors and emulators, my cursor tends to get lost! It's hard to explain but I feel like enabling these has made me 1% more productive overall.

Really, comparing my 2016 setup to my current, not much has changed. Everything is "better" - better display, better speakers, nicer desk mat, but I also think that if I woke up tomorrow and I had my old setup again, I wouldn't really even be that disappointed. I could probably dock my current laptop to it all just fine anyways!

I suppose one of the biggest changes is that I've completely de-googled my life. I can't think of any google products or services I use on a regular basis voluntarily besides search. I primarily use Apple software whenever possible, including Safari, Mail, Calendar, etc. I have spent active effort to remove google products from my life, and replace them with either something neutral (like Fastmail for email, which I pay for), or whatever Apple has. I actually spend active time trying to _more deeply_ integrate into the Apple ecosystem, trying to understand the design philosophy behind decisions that on the surface seem obtuse. Some things are just not good, but I have to say - the grass is greener over here for sure. One of my top anxieties was "will google kill [niche service I rely on]", or even worse "will google ban me?". At one point I wouldn't even be able to pay my phone bill without my google account. That thought is truly terrifying. Because you are google's product, not their customer, they do not support you because they have no financial incentive to. One less gmail user is meaningless and way better for them to be safe than sorry. This poor "customer service" led me to actively fear doing financial business with google, fearing that an expired credit card would lead to my phone being shut off.

I am earnestly speaking, not trying to start a flame war, just sharing my perspective. I've spent a lot of time thinking about this, even in [public experiments](iphone-pros-and-cons.html) [here on this blog](/android-wear-moto-360-review.html)! I didn't grow up in the Apple ecosystem at all. As a fan of open source software, I eagerly watched as google prepared to launch Android. The Apple stuff was cool for sure, but it felt extremely unattainable. Despite the fact that I worked full-time in Apple retail sales, [it wasn't until I was provided a 15" MacBook for my first "real" development job that I even personally owned a new Apple product](/lore.html#:~:text=One%20evening%2C%20maybe,be%20chiseled%20infinitely.). Why didn't I own any Apple products? Because they're really freakin' expensive! I was broke, could barely make rent. So when Google was releasing the Nexus 5 for $349 unlocked, I felt like I could participate in the current trends. I don't want to use the old iPhone, I want new! I want the latest software. But times change, google changed, I changed, and my needs changed. I now have kids with their own technology needs and frankly, Apple's ecosystem is just a lot more put together. I have also set up family groups with google, and they work well on Chrome OS. As a customer of (not the product of) Apple, I feel entitled to a certain level of customer service. I think Apple is inclined to provide optimal customer service because it makes them money. Simply put, I don't trust google any more, and I trust Apple. I especially trust [end-to-end encryption](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756), [sensible account recovery options](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109345), [their commitment to building products that respect my privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).

So I use an iPhone now. Currently rocking the 15 Pro Max for that sweet, sweet telephoto lens. It's really heavy! The 15 Pro was the first to use Titanium for the body which is a lot lighter than stainless steel, but it's still heavy. If I upgraded to the 16 Pro, I'd get the smaller one now that it has the nice telephoto as well. I'm a lot less careful with my phone these days because I feel like I can be. I stopped using a case and screen protector after I started buying Apple Care and I'm constantly blown away at how durable it is! I've dropped it _so many times_ where I've thought "well, that's it" only to be shocked that it's fine. I've literally seen the phone slide down asphalt on the screen and nothing happened. I definitely have some pretty good scratches at this point but they really don't bother me, I don't notice them. I'm convinced the primary source of my phone scratches are the rivets on my jeans, but I don't have any hard evidence to back that up. Being able to plug in my USB-C dongles is kind of game changer for me. I love playing my electric drum kit and streaming via Instagram Live. I just stick the phone in a grip mounted at myself, plug in my audio input dongle and pipe the drum audio directly into the phone.

I listened through the Walter Isaacson {% include external_link.html href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_(book)" text="Steve Jobs biography" %} a few years ago, before switching to Apple, and one thing that's always stood out to me was the philosophy Steve Jobs had behind what he wanted computers to _be_ for normal people, how they should use them. He wanted every home to have a full digital creative studio in it. I hate to sound corny, but I really see that ethos built into a lot of the Apple products. GarageBand is incredible, iMovie is totally usable, not to mention Pages/Keynote/Numbers. I'm not arguing that professionals should use this software (though they certainly _can_). But if I told you to go buy me that software for any other platform, it would likely cost about $1,000 to get something comparable. So people don't just have a fully working digital audio workstation laying around when they have some strange musical inclination - unless they do. My kids "play" GarageBand on the phones and tablets. I honestly don't even know what or how they do it, I just know they make music that's fun to dance to! I'm not at all arguing that these are a suitable replacement for real creative education in public schools, but as a supplement and self-directed experience, I really think it is enabling new generations to be more creative more easily.

Ideally, I use my phone to create things. Primarily artifacts of my life in the form of photos and videos. But also audio, and documents. One of the final holdouts in the google world was photos but I finally exported that entire library into iCloud. Having my entire photo library all the way back to my very first phone is incredible. I have several widgets set up of the photo memory highlights and it actually improves my life in a tangible way. My kids are old enough that seeing a random old photo of one of them is enough to make me take a moment to pause and reflect. I'm quite interested to see what kind of effects this kind of documentation will have on my kids lives. Will it give them a more accurate self-image? Or cause them to be self-conscious? 

I also consume content on my phone. I like a lot of long-form YouTube content about video games and history when I sleep. Do you think I can actually absorb some of that information while asleep or am I frying my brain? I feel like it helps me sleep. I also read books, in the Apple Books app. I really like the Books app and having all my books with me always is really great. Some social media, trying to limit. I'm basically down to Instagram and Mastodon. Mastodon is fun, a lot of my friends are on Instagram but it really seems like Meta is actively trying to sabotage that product so we'll see what happens. So far, I'm very enthusiastic about the next generation of federated and open social media applications.

In my closet, I have a little NAS/server I built a few years ago that serves as a backup and media server (and, if we're being honest, a fun hobby for me to play with). It's got a little i3-10105 and 7766MiB of the cheapest RAM I could find on amazon. At the time or writing, the uptime is 62 days - which I find incredible. On it, I run OpenMediaVault which I really love, after trying out the other more popular True/FreeNAS. It's based on Debian and I'm not sure what they did, but it's _incredibly stable_. Updates never require a reboot. The built-in container support has been actually quite enabling for me to play with docker more.

We have a TV - literally the cheapest one I could find at Costco. It does not know my Wi-Fi password. I have an Apple TV that we use to watch movies and shows on Disney+, as well as archived media on Plex. I don't really like Plex at this point - but it's what I have. We also watch YouTube on the TV - our favorite family show is {% include external_link.html href="https://www.youtube.com/outdoorboys" text="Outdoor Boys!" %} We have a family tradition of watching the newest episode every other week after church on Sunday.

I suppose it's worth mentioning that I wear an Apple Watch, though I'm not exactly sure why any more. Medication reminders are genuinely nice on it. I have a cellular model and it's nice to be able to just leave my phone in the hotel if I'm going out so I don't worry about losing or breaking it but still being able to be reachable.
