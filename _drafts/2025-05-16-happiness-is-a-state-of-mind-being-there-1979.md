I have a vivid memory of my friend Taylor telling me about this movie for the first time. "There's this guy, and he doesn't know _anything_. Like anything at all, it's insane. I think this would be your favorite movie. It's literally the most Dave DeGraw movie of all time."

A bold statement that proved to be far more prophetic than either of us gave it credit for.

The first time I watched the movie, I was actually disguisted and depressed. I had no idea how to interpret what I was watching. The deadpan comedy did strike with me, but the story and what to make of it all left me quite devastated.

It seems like _Being There_ is a bit obscure these days. I don't know why, I was suprised to see the film came out in the late 70's. It could have been the 90's for all I know. It's just as relevant, if not more so, today than ever.

The film is about a man named Chance. As far was we know, that's the only name he was ever given. He has lived his entire life for his entire memory in the same upscale 1930's style house somewhere in the Washington D.C. area. There, he has been employed as a gardener. Chance has apparently had little or no contact with the outside world. He's fully socialized, but he can't even read or write. Really, the only thing that seems to have informed him on any kind of reality at all is the TV sets spread hilariously throughout every room of the mansion including the basement, garden, and attic.

I suppose that may be the intended conclusion - a boy born likley out of wedlock and cared for but neglected all the same. He has no birth certificate, no identification, no proof of existing at all.

That all changes abruptly when "the old man" dies. Chance clearly has no emotional or intellectual capacity to process what is happening. After examining the dead body, he turns to watch the TV. I think this is why I was left so upset by my first viewing. Chance comes off as unsympathetic, cold, and unrelatable. However, I've come to learn he's so much more than that. He gives exactly what the world has given him, in fact he gives more. So if "the old man" is his father, or as much of a father as he's known, I feel turning on the TV that your father provided you would be a fair tribute to his despicable legacy as a caretaker. But we can't make too many assumptions! The film is deliberate in what it reveals and doesn't reveal about Chance's past.

Chance is a peculiar fellow, and one of the peculiarities is his manner of dress and grooming. He explains that his clothing is all of "the old man's" clothing, which consists of 1930's era custom tailored suits. I think the best way to describe Chance is a total moron dressed and with the manners of a successfull, professional businessperson.
As movie luck has it, Chance finds himself outside a TV store displaying a camera pointed back at him on a giant screen TV. It might be the first time he's ever seen himself, but espescially on TV, his very favorite thing. As he steps back to get a better view, a Cadillac limosuine backs into him, pinning him between another car.

Seeing the sharp and respectable, not to mention extremely mild-manered, man they'd backed into needed help, a wealthy young woman decides to bring Chance back to "the house" for treatment and care.

I used to do a lot of interviewing. As in, I was interviewing candidtes to be hired. It's quite an interesting experience if you're never been on the other side of the table. One thing they tell you pretty quickly is a few questions you're not legally allowed to ask a candidate to answer such as family and personal questions. I had no inclination to ask about that anyways, but it did cause me to note how often candidates would simply volunteer that information freely as part of the interview. It was actually a little awkward for me, feeling like I wasn't supposed to know something in an already delicate and stressful process.

I served a 2 year service mission in rural Kentucky proseliting for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints at age 19. It was quite the place to be dropped, fresh out of a comfortable suburban adolsecence in Southern Utah. I learned a lot about that area, and I grew to really love the people and their outlook on life. They've had their unique share of struggles as a region. First the tobacco farming contracts got vacuumed up by the big growers. The old drying barns are still around, but I only saw tobacco drying in one a single time. Then the interstates were built, wiping out any of the small town dining and lodging options that used to litter our American highways. Now coal is on it's way out. A lot of people are left with really no way of life. There's no industry, schools are far and scarce. Travelling is expensive.

When I say I was "proselyting", I mean that I was walking around with one other kid also in my same situation. We couldn't afford to drive much, so we'd park our car and walk for miles and miles and miles, knocking on every door we could see. You end up running into quite a few interesting characters from all walks of life that way. As time went on, I made another asessment. Often, individuals would volunteer information to the effect of "I don't use drugs. I used to be into it bad, but not any more." I learned that this statement was aspirational, usually meaning _as of that moment_ the person was expressing to me a willingness to want to get out of the hell that is substance abuse and addiction. I had no frame of reference for this information. All I could do was invite them to do things to make their life better. Unfortunately addiction can rob us of our free-will and these individuals often struggled to keep their commitments. I actually believe that two young kids in white shirts way out there on your front doorstep shocked some kind of bolt through their very soul to take a strong look at their situation and reflect on it, from what they must have thought was my perspective.

Never mind the empty pill bottles _littered_ throughout the house. Never mind the decrepid and dishevled interior. Never mind the white powder literally caked on the nostrils of the adults as children sit idly in the other room. As of that moment, their reality was that they didn't do drugs any more.

Assuming his high-class origin, Chance is welcomed with open arms by the dozen or so servants and the family of some disguistingly wealthy man. He's old, he's dying. Being kept alive by a medicinal puppet show. But the end is close and frankly his gigantic estate is no real home. Seriously, they flimed this at the [Biltmore Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biltmore_Estate), the largest privately owned house in the United States. It's wealth to a degree that excess doesn't even begin to describe. They said that the old days of feudal lords are over, but this guy makes me question that.

Being mostly an empty bag of hot air, Chance usually simply repeats back what people say to him in a thoughtful or questioning way, or with the same emotion and enthusiasm the person talking to him has. He's a mirror.  It's an extreme childlike earnestness that makes the movie what it is. "I understand." is his default response when he clearly has no idea what is going on.

So just how far can you fall up if you're a white guy wearing a 3-peice suit? In _Being There_, it's suggested Chance will likely become the President of the United States. And this is where the review will go off the rails.

I've said it here before - everyone is an expert on themselves. We love looking at our faces, studying the details of our bodies with every sense in every moment. We know what we're thinking. We know what we're _feeling_. We make attempts at communicating, but they often fall short.

After I've pondered it, I realize I actually do sympathize with Mr. Chauncy Gardener as his name becomes. At a certain point I realized that I'm also a white guy, but I'm over 6 feet tall, I have hair, and blue eyes. To me, that combination means nothing. You could swap out any of those attributes with anything and it would all be the same to me. But to everybody else, for my entire life, that's meant something else. It's meant that I have a certain level of self-confidence and self-esteem that quite frankly, isn't there. My observation is that people often assess that I likely have (or should have) _more_ confidence than they do. In my experience, we like to delegate social structures. Who's the person running the meeting? Who's directing the conversation? We make these social judgements very quickly and with very little useful information. A lot of times, it's just what the other person looks like.

There have been many times in my life where I've hurt someone's feeling simply because I didn't have the self-esteem to see myself as they did. I literally assume everyone is being mean to me, by default. Especially growing up. If a kid walked up and asked me something, I would certainly assume they were making fun of me. I understand now that not only were they not even trying to be mean to me, but that in treating them _as if they were_ being mean to me is actually the only "mean" part of the situation! _I'm the mean one._

I'm not trying to be, I'm just awkward. Maybe not even awkward, just sheltered; inexperienced. Like that kid taking a guy for his word that he didn't do drugs. Generally speaking people are so overwhelming that I find myself with no clue how to act. I struggle with a filter - it's either on or off. When that filter comes off, usually people walk away with at least a little red in their cheeks due to some off-handed comment I made. It's just who I am. I hope they also come away with a little memory they'll chuckle about from time to time.

I used to have a single binary filter. Either totally comfortable and open, or totally hostile and afraid. Sometimes I feel like it's almost a split personality. I'm "talking to them" or I'm _talking to them_. Sometimes I _talk to_ people that are expecting me to "talk to" them, and they get extremely freaked out. I honestly think I may have caused some of the overall most traumatic and terrifying moments of someone's life just because I didn't properly mask my extreme intrigue.

Chance is an alien in his own world. The moments he leaves his home for the first time is scored by the same sound you'll recognize from _2001 A Space Odyssey_. He may as well be on Mars as he explores his neighborhood for the first time, an old run-down neighborhood filled with vagrancy and garbage.

Chance doesn't even know the concept of good and evil. He's completely honest on all occasions. I think this is why he's so successful.
