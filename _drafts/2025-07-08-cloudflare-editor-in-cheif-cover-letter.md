My name is Dave DeGraw. I live with my wife and 4 children in beautiful Southern Utah. We love raising our kids in the same town we both grew up in!

I love Cloudflare more than almost anything. I love building with Cloudflare. It's like an addiction. It started small - a quick worker. The Cloudflare developer experience sucked me in immediately. Since then, I've built the best products of my life using Cloudflare's platform exclusively.

The only other technology I might love more than or as much as Cloudflare is my blog and personal website - [catskull.net](https://catskull.net). I've maintained this blog for the last 12 years. At this point, it's as much a part of who I am as anything.

As I've built with Cloudflare, I've documented my projects in blog posts. I want to help other people build cool stuff!

A few things I'm especially proud of:
- [A decentralized Facebook-style "like" button for any page.](https://catskull.net/public-web-comments-with-cloudflare-email-workers.html) (Workers + D1 + Web Component)
- [Replies, an email-powered authless public comment system.](https://catskull.net/public-web-comments-with-cloudflare-email-workers.html) (Email Workers + D1 + Web Component)
- [Notes](https://catskull.net/notes) and [Wiki](https://catskull.net/wiki-archive.html). (Workers + GitHub API + Apple Shortcuts)
- [Image URL transforms Jekyll Plugin.](https://catskull.net/optimize-jekyll-images-with-cloudflare-image-transformations.html) (Image Transforms)
- [A micro-chat room for any page, pre-filled with some unique (AI) personalities.](https://catskull.net/the-most-dangerous-app.html) (Durable Objects + Workers AI
)

I've been able to direct the internship program at the last two companies I was with. As a former intern myself, I value my mentors and the experiences they guided me through very highly. Working with interns has been the most rewarding part of my career. Mentoring them and seeing the fantastic careers they've built for themselves counts tenfold in my heart.

In addition to my personal blog, I started a technical blog for our development organization. I coordinated a regular cadence by working with team leads to identify topics and team members who could write a blog post. It was rewarding to help people who had never published writing before.

I had a great entrepreneurial experience bootstrapping a hardware company in my college apartment, Catskull Electronics. As I grew and learned, I shared what I learned at professional conferences and music festivals (OpenWest, MAGFest, SquareSounds Tokyo) by hosting panels and offering sessions specifically about small-scale hardware manufacturing.

I am your ideal candidate for the role of "Editor-in-Chief" of the Cloudflare Blog. The job description states: "The Cloudflare Blog is not a marketing tool. Itâ€™s a widely-read technical publication, trusted by millions of developers, engineers, researchers, and curious minds." I want to fulfill that vision! I want to work on the Cloudflare blog because I _love_ Cloudflare, I _love_ blogging, and I _love_ making it easier for all ability levels to use the incredible technology Cloudflare is building.

I have a deep understanding and appreciation for the excellent work you have already done with the blog. Your blog posts, and the discussions they generate, are an essential guide for any modern developer. I have studied carefully your (thankfully rare) incident postmortems. I especially love that you allow and even expect your interns to participate!

I very much look forward to speaking with you further to better understand your vision for the blog and how I might be able to help you fulfill it!

PS.
I love lava lamps.
