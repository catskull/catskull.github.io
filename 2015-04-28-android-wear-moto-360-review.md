Just over a year ago, Google unveiled Android Wear, their version of Android specifically tailored for so-called "smart watches" or "wearables". Among the first devices announced was the Moto 360. As the name implies, it was extremely notable due to it's completely round display - something almost completely unheard of at the time (and even extremely uncommon today). Though the first two Android Wear devices launched on June 25, 2014 at Google's I/O, the much anticipated Moto 360 wouldn't be available until September 5. It seemed somewhat odd that the flagship smart watch wouldn't be the first to arrive. It was announced at that same I/O that "everyone [there] whould receive their own Moto 360......when they are available...". Why wouldn't Google just give everyone an LG G watch, since they were already available? The world may never know. That detail isn't really the point of this post though.

My initial reaction to the announcement was excitement. It came before the Apple Watch was official in any way, so it was really the first of it's kind. Sure there were things like the pebble and whatever samsung was scamming people into buying, but a major competitor backing their own OS was exciting thing. Developers would enjoy a very similar experience to what they were used to on normal Android (much the same way iOS developers were greeted by the Apple Watch tools). The announcement video had some examples of people using it. There were a lot of people biking. That was my first problem, I don't bike. Like, ever. Still though, I could use it....driving? Yeah, I could use it driving, I reassured myself. They did things like open a garage by speaking to their watch using the familiar Google Now catchphrase "Ok, Google". I was and still am a huge user of Google Now so I found that very exciting. I could have Google Now on my wrist at all times! But how did they open the garage? Does Android Wear come with the ability to integrate with all existing garage door openers? (As a side note, I would go on to develop my own IoT garage door opener, though we never made an Android Wear watch and I never had a garage.)

Watching the video a second (or third, or fourth) time, my excitment began to wain. Literally every single one of the examples they used were people doing things that I _never_ did. Catching a plane, riding on a bus, giving kids a bath, surfing, _literally dancing while waiting in a long line to Chromeo_. Chromeo for heavens sake! Google either seriously over-estimated the average consumer, or they were genius in believing they could convince the average consumer that they were cool enough that they did all these things. And lets face it, if I were ever riding on a bus, I would be already staring at my phone! If by some miracle I was not, I _definately_ would not be comfortable replying to a text with my voice, out loud, on a crowded bus. Now way, Jose.

So what would _I_ do with a smart watch? I sit at a desk for 8 hours a day, drive home, and sit on a couch for the other 4-5 before going to bed. Now remember, I do use Google Now extensively, but all of the times I do, it is not inconvenient to take a phone out of my pocket. I don't use Google Now while running down the street, raking leaves, or grocery shopping. Well, take that back, I use it grocery shopping when I'm trying to find out which song they're playing on the radio (it's always Fleetwood Mac). I use Google Now when I'm hanging out with my wife or friends and someone says "Which president built Mount Rushmore anyways?" It's easier to whip it out, and from the lock screen say "Ok Google, which president built Mount Rushmore?" I also feel like it's more conversational as well, as I don't actually have to be looking at the screen while I'm doing any of those things. I can still be visually participating in a conversation. I do have to look at the phone once the result comes in, but that's _still_ conversational because I read it out loud, to everyone. It works very well. Doing any of this one a watch would be any more or less convenient. But hey, it would definatly be cooler, right? Mr. James Bond over here figuring out how deep the mariana trench is by a simple voice command.

I was never a big watch person. I have small girly wrists, so anything big or heavy is annoying to me. I had a Casio Calculator watch for a while though, and that was okay. Suffice to say I'm not really a watch persion. That was the first nail in the coffin, thinking back.

I think I remember telling myself I would be willing to try an Android Wear device if the price point was ~$100. The Moto 360 was announced for $249 and the LG G watch was $189. So that's wear my willingness to try and adopt this technology came to a screeching halt. Since then, I've tentatively watched as the platform evolved and as a few more devices came along. All of them were still out of my price range. And with every review I still had an unanswered question: What does it actually _do_? More importantly, what would _I_ do with it?

This progressed for about a year. The Apple Watch was announced to fanfair. I was impressed that people were so excited about it, given it's cost. It reinforced my suspision that a man will buy anything at any price as long as it's "cool" enough, and a woman will buy anything at any price as long as it's "cute" enough.

Interestingly enough, my first real interaction with wearable was indeed the Apple Watch. I just happened to be near an Apple store and had time to kill, so I wandered in to take a peek. I tapped the screen, twisted the wheel, pressed both buttons, and left having absolutely no idea what it actually did, or how someone would actually use it. It was definately cool though. In a way, it was remeniscint of the obelisk from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Oddesey, where I was a monkey and the Apple Watch was the mysterioius obelesk. I'd love to say that upon touching it for the first time I started screeching, or was enlightened into the next plane of existance, but I didn't and I wasn't. Then looking at the price tag and having a mini heart attack for even touching something so expensive, I felt alone and fearful.

That was before the Apple Watch was available for purchase.

Shortly after, it came out and a few friends started posting about it. It became a humorous habit of mine to exclaim "Wow, an iWatch! What does it do?" and listen to cobbled together responeses about how it's nice to not have to pull out their _huge_ phone (how ironic, right?) any time they wanted to do something like check the weather. On the surface, the answer to that question seemed to be "Basically the same thing as my phone, but different and on my wrist" but deeper down the answer was almost dark: "I don't really know."

It was then I decided I must finally discover what one actually did with a smart watch. I resolved I must purchase a device and use it for maybe a week, in both extreme situations. On a vacation where I would be up and about in unfamiliar places needing constant directions and travel tips, and at my desk doing the same thing I did every day.

I purchased a Moto 360 for $249.99 from Target, but not before expliclity going over the return policy with the cashier.
