##My name is David DeGraw

I'm a freelance web developer and electrical engineering student. I enjoy technology, electronics, non-fiction, and spending time with my wife. We live in Provo, Utah. We had our first child (a son) in May 2015 and couldn't be more excited! I'm always looking for interesting things to do and learn about, so please feel free to contact me!

This site is built with Jekyll, hosted on Github Pages and uses the Laynon theme.

You can find me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/davidwdegraw), [github](http://github.com/catskull), or email me directly at <bro@catskull.net>.
