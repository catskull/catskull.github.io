   <title>Ditching the Arduino IDE</title>
   <link href="http://catskull.net/tutorials,/arduino/2015/06/21/arduino-ide-atom/"/>

   <id>http://catskull.net/tutorials,/arduino/2015/06/21/arduino-ide-atom</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, my good friend and crazy talented hacker Ultifinitus gave me some sweet hardware. Out of the goodness of his heart. What a nice guy! It consisted of an Arduino Mega and some other stuff that I’ll go more into in a later post. I haven’t done a ton of arduino stuff in the past, but I’ve done enough to know that the default Arduino IDE sucks. Those may be strong words I guess, it’s open source and cross platform and it works, but it just has a pretty poor text editor. I decided if I was going to do anything worthwhile with the hardware, I needed an environment I could be productive in. Specifically, I like using Github’s excellent editor, Atom. It’s open source, cross platform, and is a pretty great text editor! This post will serve as a reference for what I was able to get set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atom needs almost no customization out of the box. The only package to install is &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/packages/language-arduino&quot;&gt;language-arduino&lt;/a&gt; which “adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Arduino files in Atom”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real meat and potatoes is &lt;a href=&quot;http://inotool.org/&quot;&gt;Ino&lt;/a&gt;. This is a command line interface for building and uploading arduino code. It works pretty well. Install it with pip by executing &lt;code&gt;pip install ino&lt;/code&gt;. (As a side note, I use python every day at work and a &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; fell a little gross every time I use pip. It’s like the inbred step brother of RubyGems and it makes me wish everything was written in Ruby.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the reason I feel gross for using pip is that usually the packages I’m installing are a little gross. Don’t get me wrong, I commend the men and women who spend hours upon end doing the thankless task of contributing to open source projects, only to be berated with senseless issues and internet trolls. I guess if I have issues with some open source software I’m using I should just contribute and try to fix it, but one project at a time right? Ino has more good than bad all things considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So once you’ve gotten ino installed, there’s very little you need to do in the way of setting it up. Navigate to the directory you want to keep your project. For me its &lt;code&gt;ddegraw/code/new_project&lt;/code&gt; and execute an &lt;code&gt;ino init&lt;/code&gt; command. This will create a src and a lib directory. src is where you’ll keep your code, and lib is useless. lib is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be where you put libraries you want to use, but I (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amperka/ino/issues/164&quot;&gt;and some other people&lt;/a&gt; couldn’t get that to work so I just stuck everything in the src directory. One important thing to note is that ino &lt;em&gt;will not&lt;/em&gt; automatically scan your arduino libraries, so if you want to include anything you have to copy it over to the src directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the src folder there should be a sketch.ino created. This is where you can write the bulk of your code, consider it you “main”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have all of that set up, you’re pretty much good to go. There are a few caveats that I’d like to mention however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you should create a ino.ini file in the root of your project. Inside, you can specify which serial port to use and which board you’re targeting. For example, I’m using a mega 2560 so mine looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[build]
board-model = mega2560

[upload]
board-model = mega2560
serial-port = /dev/tty.usbmodem1421

[serial]
serial-port = /dev/tty.usbmodem1421
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each one of the [] blocks defines settings for a command. I would like it if that wasn’t the case, and instead you just chose &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; board and &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; serial port. How likely is it that you’re wanting to build for a mega2560 but upload for an Uno &lt;em&gt;within the same project&lt;/em&gt;? Fail. Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you can also put those settings in ~/.inorc, but I haven’t tried that and don’t really care to. The only advantage of that would be that those settings would be used as your global defaults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build, simply execute &lt;code&gt;ino build&lt;/code&gt; from the root of your project. To upload, simply execute &lt;code&gt;ino upload&lt;/code&gt; from the same place. Pretty simple. I made an alias to do both of those at the same time because more often than not that’s what I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s really it as far as the environment is concerned. It works fairly well and is easily as featured as the Arduino IDE is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to take a moment at the end to talk about a fork of Ino called Arturo. The creators of Ino no longer have time or motivation to maintain it. A quick look at the issues section of the GitHub repo will be a prime example of what open source hell looks like. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scottdarch&quot;&gt;Scott Dixon&lt;/a&gt; offered to take over management of the repo, but the creators preferred him to fork it. In my opinion that is a poor decision on their end, but at the same time I can understand why they would chose that. It doesn’t look like he’s made too many changes yet, but he is a very good maintainer. Issues are clear, valid, and labeled. While he doesn’t have time to work on every little feature, he does keep the issues well under control. Unfortunately, I was not able to get it to work with my device, but I’ve opened an issue and would love to help contribute to make it better. I have opened a pull request for a seperate tiny issue and it will be exciting to see how he handles contributions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, it looks like there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackaday.com/2014/04/20/sublime-text-as-an-arduino-ide/&quot;&gt;something similar&lt;/a&gt; that relies on Sublime Text. I have no desire to use or pay for Sublime Text though, but it may be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3 Review</title>
   <link href="http://catskull.net/reviews/2015/06/18/idol3/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-18T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://catskull.net/reviews/2015/06/18/idol3</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My Nexus 5 had an update this morning. From Android 5.1 to 5.1.1. I couldn’t tell you what it changed. I hope it fixed the memory leak that’s been plauging me for a while now. I doubt it did. Honestly I don’t really care any more. It’s been a great phone. I bought it almost two years ago and it’s done everything I wanted it to and more. My needs haven’t really changed since I’ve owned it, but the market for cost effective off-contract phones has. Dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June of 2014, almost a year to the date of this writing, Google announced their new “Android One” initiative. The long story is that manufacturers can build low cost devices for emerging markets and turn over the software to Google (kind of makes me wish Google would do the same for all devices, but that’s another story). The short story is that Google is currently completely dominating that market with their Android system, and with that comes the influx of new customers for their services and more faces to throw ads at. It’s a win-win. Look at the fact that the Moto G, a $149 off-contract phone is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.androidcentral.com/moto-g-motorolas-most-successful-smartphone-ever&quot;&gt;Motorola’s best selling phone of all time.&lt;/a&gt; At first that may not seem to impressive, but remember another phone Moto made at one point: the Razr. How many people did you know that owned Razrs? I knew dozens. How many people do you know that own Moto G’s? I know maybe one person. So where are all those device sales coming from? Emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to that massive success, I can’t help but imagine that other manufacturers are realizing that the need for low-cost high-quality off-contract Android devices isn’t exclusive to third world markets. We’ve seen the somewhat viral success of phones like the Oneplus One, which ships with a near stock version of Android (there’s quite a bit more to that story, but I won’t speak of it here). Motorola claims to be making a profit on each Moto G sold, so why wouldn’t other manufacturers try it out? We’ve seen devices come out from Acer, Oppo, Huwawei and others but all of them seemed to be inheritnely flawed in one way or another. But suddenly, another device showed up from a company I had never heard of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://catskull.net/public/idol3/inhand.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inexplicably named Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3. I think the company is named Alcatel Onetouch, and the phone is named Idol 3. Who cares. It retails for $249 off-contract. The 5.5 inch phone had several key features that grew my excitement: dual high quality JBL front facing speakers, a micro sd card slot, and a larger battery than my Nexus 5. That was enough to get me interested. “I’m sure they destroyed it with an awful Android skin, or it runs like Froyo or something” I told myself as I clicked links to find more. I was somewhat shocked and pleasently surprised to find out neither of those things were true. It runs a near stock Android build and currently has 5.0 lollipop. Pretty impressive as many flagship $600+ phones don’t currently have either of those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My excitement grew as I learned about some great insights Alcatel put into this experience. Since there are speakers and mics on both the top and bottom of the screen, you can hold the phone either way to talk on it and use it. Really not that great I guess, but when you get a call at 6 am because some senior citizen namen Kathy is giving out your number as her own and the senior shuttle wants to let her know that they’re there to pick her up for the day activity (yes, this happened/is happening), it can be nice. Even sublter, the speakers are slightly recessed behind the screen so if it’s face down they won’t be completely muffled. How great! I mean, the actual use of something like is arguable, but small consideration like that are very welcome in an age when the customer seems like an afterthought and all manufactureres are concerned about is how much they can cram onto their spec sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top all of that with a micro SDXC card slot. Definately not a feature I put high on my priority list, but it’s nice to have. I also loved the overall design. It looks basically like an oversized Nexus 4, another phone I owned and loved. The back is plastic but it’s brushed in a way that looks like metal. The camera sits completely flush on the back which apparently is uncommon in a day when Apple is photoshopping camera bulge out of their product pictures. The sides have two metal rings the sandwich a plastic middle. It feels fine. Honestly I’m not a huge fan of the ultra &lt;s&gt;slick&lt;/s&gt; slippery all aluminum bodies that seem to be so in style right now. All in all it was right up my alley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept waiting for the flaw that would just kill the whole deal. With hardware perfect, surely they would have completely botched the software with a horrible skin and bloatware. I was shocked to find that was not the case. They do have some customizations but they are very minimal and unubtrusive. Really the extent of it is that they changed some of the stock apps (dialer, clock, contacts, etc) icons. I would prefer it if they had left that tweak out, but they’re not bad icons by any means. There’s also a “sweep all” icon on the multi tasking menu. I like the concept, but it does this really weird animation where it will swipe the app to the far side, hang for a moment, then get rid of it. It really looks like it’s lagging but it’s not. But really, this was far more stock Android than not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that, I was sold. I’ll admit that I tentatavely held out for Google I/O in hopes they would announce an updated Nexus 5 which of course they didn’t because screw you that’s why. After that I pulled the trigger, and I pulled it hard. I even upgraded for one day shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the box was the phone, a wall charger, a USB cable, a sim card ejector, and incredibly a pair of high quality JBL earbuds. I’d say the headphones are worth and easy $20 at least. They’re really great! All the other accessories were equally high quality. They definately did not skimp on packaging or accessories, something surprising in a phone this low budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first took the phone out of the box, I was a little bit shocked at how large it is. Sure they say 5.5 inches but who the heck knows what that actually feels like? Though now that I say that, the iPhone 6+ is also 5.5 inches. My friend Colton got one of those and when I saw it I was in disbelief. It just seemed unusabely huge. This phone definately feels big, but not as big as the 6+. It has a nice 1080p display that really looks quite good. In fact, it is the best display I have ever seen when in direct sunlight. In the past I’ve just gotten used to not being able to see anything on my phone if I was outside in the sun, but this phone isn’t like that. It’s almost hard to explain. I have no idea what they did to the display to make that happen, but other phones have a lot to take from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should go back to the speakers. They are absolutely incredible. They reach levels almost ludicrously loud. Setting an alarm I had to set it on the lowest possible setting other than mute in order to not completely fall out of my bed in the morning. Music, movies, and games all sound incredible on this. Combine that with a 5.5 inch laminated 1080p display and this phone is a true media experience. Something I had never seen or expereinced on really any portable device, especially a phone. Showing my wife a funny video I came across was an absolute treat, even in a busy restaurant. The speakers can more than handle it. I find myself actually using the phone as more of a portable speaker. Playing music while in the shower is totally fine. I probably wouldn’t DJ my housewarming party with it, but it’s great for pretty much anything other than that. While navigating, I enjoy getting crystal clear directions, even if the phone is in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of having the phone in my pocket, it doesn’t like to stay there! I think it’s a combination of how big the phone is, as well as how thin and light it is, but it just slides right out of my pocket. I’ve had to fish it out from under the car’s seat several times. Even at work sometimes sitting in my chair, I’ll just hear a plop and the phones on the ground. That issue has been negated somewhat by using a cheap (though nice) gel/rubbery case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real reason for buying a case wasn’t so much to help with the sliding, but another issue. The screen’s bezels are so thin on the sides that when holding it with one hand I frequently would accidentally touch the sides of the screen and click things and wreak all sorts of havok. Who would have thought, the phones bezels being too thin would be an issue? That was really why I got the case, just to give me a little something more to hold onto. And it’s a nice case as well, super thin and looks great. With the added protection, it’s more than worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another slight annoyance is the button layout. The power button is on the upper left side, with the volume buttons on the upper right side. Basically opposite from any other phone. I have no clue why Alcatel would go for something like that, but it’s a really minor issue. You could say that there’s just as much reason to have the power on the left as there is to have it on the right. And it was maybe a day getting used to so no complaints there. One tiny quirk is that the micro USB charging slot is not centered on the bottom of the phone, but more off to the right of the bottom of the phone. Again, not really an issue, but it’s just interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Idol 3 has an incredible battery in my opinion. 3000mah, roughly on par with the 6+’s battery. This thing can go all day with NFC, WiFi, cellular, as well as moderate use with at least 50% left at the end of the day. That I love. It seemed like my Nexus 5 just ripped through it’s battery, whether I used it or not. It will be interesting to see if battery life diminishes at all as I use it more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software was a little bit worst and a little bit better than I expected it. Most of the apps are the stock Android Open Source apps. Things like the dialer, clock, etc. The issue is that those open source apps aren’t really considered to be “stock” Android apps because Google has gone off and made their own proprietary versions. So they are not the same apps that show up on a Nexus device. Well, I guess that’s not entirely true. It’s very close. It came pre loaded with some “bloatware” apps. I actually don’t even remember what they were because uninstalling them was the first thing I did. Keyword there: uninstall. Because you can. You’re not locked into anything. Alcatel also included a few of their own utility apps like a file manager, a notes app, and a sound recorder. They are high quality and actually usefule. They keep very much the theme of material design and I think you’d be surprised to find out Google didn’t make them. They’re all things I had on my phone anyways, so it’s just nice to have them there. The phone does have a slightly tweaked launcher, but I uninstalled that in favor of the Google Now Launcher. The only drawback is that the phone features a double tap to wake/lock feature. Waking works fine (well, sort of), but double tap to lock only works in their stock launcher. Oh well I guess. It also has an FM radio built in, which is cool and maybe potentially useful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the camera app is custom made my Alcatel. I tried the Google camera, and it was laggy and didn’t work nearly as well as the stock camera, so I switched to that. I rarely take pictures on my phone, so it is a bit of a moot point for me. I can say that the camera doesn’t dissappoint me. I have a DSLR camera for when I want to take DSLR quality photos. Snapping pics of my son works just fine with this camera. I guess I’m neither impressed or uninmpressed. I just don’t really care about a phone’s camera. If it didin’t have one, I might not even notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The double tap to wake just doesn’t really work that well. Half the time it straight up doesn’t work, and when it does it takes so long to respond that I’ve already pressed the actual button and they end up cancelling each other out. Alcatel has promised to tweak it in future updates, but we’ll see what happens. Honestly I’m not really crossing my fingers, though software updates are what will make or break this phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community support (aka custom roms) is still very limited (nonexistant) at this point. It’s just too early to tell. Alcatel has promised to release the source code for the bootloader and rom in order to comply with the GPL. I honestly have faith that they will. It will be nice to see where we’re at a year from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it’s not a “flagship killer” by any means. It isn’t supposed to be either though. This phone is intended to redefine what an off-contract phone can be, and it certainly does that. Alcatel put more thought into what customers might actually want than Samsung could do if their lives depended on it. I think that’s the best way to describe this phone: it’s just great to use. I don’t need lasers in my camera. I don’t need 100 megapixels in my camera. I don’t want a 4k display crammed into my pocket. And I don’t need an 8 core processor with 8 gigabytes of ram to check my email. This phone has exactly the specs it needs to have. Nothing more, nothing less. With that, it has exactly the price it needs to have. This is the first portable I’ve owned that I felt like I could actually use for what I wanted to do with it. It looks great, and it feels great. I don’t regret getting rid of the Nexus 5 at all. I’m sure other phones will come along, and I can only hope they take some queus from this incredible phone.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Lagrange Point Famicom English Hack</title>
   <link href="http://catskull.net/projects/2015/06/05/lagrange-point/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-05T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://catskull.net/projects/2015/06/05/lagrange-point</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few posts back I documented converting a Famicom game (Princess Tomato and the Salad Kingdom) to use the English translation. Since that went so well, I finally had the courage to try the game I really wanted to do: Lagrange Point. I think it’s fair for me to do a little background on this incredible game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/famicom/lagrangefront.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The coolest game ever?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lagrange Point was developed by Konami and released in Japan for the Nintendo Famicom on April 26, 1991 (two days before I was born!). It’s a totally rad space opera rpg with some unique game mechanics that make it quite fun. It also had some audio features that I’ll go into more detail about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Famicom supported “expansion audio”. That is, game cartridges were able to have their own sound chips to expand what the Famicom was normally capable of making. Several games took advantage of this, such as Castlevania 3. In fact several Konami games used that feature. Perhaps one of the most unique was Lagrange Point. It was one of two games to use the Konami VRC-7 sound chip. The VRC-7 was extremely unique because it was an FM synthesis module. I won’t go into detail on what exactly FM sound synthesis is (mostly because I don’t really know), but I can show you an example of what it sounds like. The Sega Genesis was perhaps the most famous home console that used an FM chip (one very similar to the VRC-7) for it’s sound. Here’s a video to show what it sounds like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISECbbAoBlw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can probably hear for yourself the difference a lot better than I can explain it to you. Now, imagine having that sound capability as well as the somewhat excellent sound capability the Famicom already had! Pure retro soundtrack goodness. I suggest you listen to Lagrange Point’s soundtrack while reading the rest of this post (and while you are, think about how primitive the original Mario Bros. sounded compared to something like this):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/drwX7MbB_IE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to some complexities Lagrange Point has, it wasn’t until very recently that it was fan translated into English. Huge thanks to excellent hacker group Aeon Genesis (the guys that originally translated Cave Story as well) for the awesome job they did! Check out the translation patch &lt;a href=&quot;http://agtp.romhack.net/project.php?id=lagrange&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One difference between Lagrange Point and other Famicom games is that Konami themselves actually produced the boards. This is for our advantage! As you may have seen on my other cart hack, the mask rom and the eprom did not have equivilant pinouts so it was necessary to lift some of the legs and jump around with some wires. Luckilly, Konami used the standard eprom pinouts on their mask rom. What this means for us is that we can simply drop the new eprom in place of the old one! No lifting or jumping required! How thoughtful of them! So really it was quite simple to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a 27C4001 eprom made by ST Microelectronics. I was able to find 10 of them on eBay for $10 shipped. Not bad! You can use this chip in a lot of Famicom/NES reproductions, so you’re probably safe to stock up on them. Lagrange Point has only PRG-ROM so only one chip was required. Flash that puppy and drop it in and you’re in business!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few things along the way that I’d like to have documented for other people that may want to do this. First, Lagrange Point takes about 1 full second to go from a grey screen to the starting screen. So if you’re just testing it out, make sure you don’t just turn the console on and off quickly thinking you’ve failed. Leave it on for a little bit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll repeat it again: you don’t need to lift any legs on the eprom. Just remove the mask rom and put your eprom in it’s place. Pin one should go on the bottom left. The mask rom also has a circle by pin one. Make sure your rom is the correct orientation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also was able to replace the battery and put a socket in it’s place for easy changing in the future. I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com/itm/5-x-New-Button-Coin-Cell-Battery-Socket-Holder-Case-CR2032-Black-/190622584472?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;amp;hash=item2c61fdce98&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; socket. It was just a little bit too long, so I had to bend the legs in a tiny bit, then I used a clamp to make it flush with the PCB while I soldered it in place. It fit back inside the cartridge shell with no problems!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought I still needed to lift the legs and use wire jumpers. Once I figured out that I didn’t, I put the rom back in couldn’t get it to work. I may have not been leaving the console on long enough, or I may have damaged my rom. Eventually I just used a new eprom and it worked the first time! However, by removing and socketing the rom so many times, I damaged my board! Two pads were lifted, so I just traced the routes and jumped those pins to where they needed to go. Not ideal, but it works without problems. I absolutely hate to damage a game that’s so unique and relatively expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that this post can help others who might want to try this themselves, and hopefully prevent people from breaking their boards! Please get in contact with me if you have any questions at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some pictures:&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mid-Week Summer Project!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synopsys: In 1985 Nintendo released the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America to huge commercial success. This was particularly impressive due to the fact that the home video game market was in a slump caused by a market flood of cheaply made games and systems. Part of the reason the NES was such a success was that Nintendo marketed the console as a complete “home entertainment system” that was so much more than just a video game console. It wasn’t really, but the marketing paid off. That’s why it looks more like a VCR than a video game system, and the first release was even bundled with a robot! Two years earlier, Nintendo had dome something very similar in Japan by releasing the Family Computer, or as it’s more commonly known the Famicom. The two systems were essentially identical internally but had vastly different designs aesthetically. One important difference was that games for the Famicom had a smaller 60 pin form factor as opposed to the NES’ wider 72 pin connectors. Interestingly enough, several early NES games were just the Famicom pcbs with a converter inside. There were 2 models of the NES produced as well as 2 models of the Famicom. What’s interesting is that the 2nd model of both the NES and the Famicom looked almost exactly alike, but with some pretty important changes internally. The 2nd model NES (the “toploader”) only had RF out (remember the old single wire coaxial cable for your TV?) That produced pretty poor video. The 2nd model Famicom however featured full composite (RCA) video which produced arguably the best video signal of any of the 1st generation Nintendo consoles. So, I bought one. It’s still possible to play NES games with a 72 to 60 pin converter. However Famicom games are readily available and even after importing they’re usually cheaper than the NES counterparts. The one issue is that all the text is in Japanese! Some games that don’t have much text (Mario Bros.) are easily playable, but some games have more text and are nearly impossible. That’s where this project comes in! I’ll be converting a Japanese Famicom cartridge to the English version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details: NES/Famicom games are distributed online as ‘roms’ which is just one file. There were several different hardware revisions of cartridge PCB’s due to the limited way the NES could access them. In this project the game is fairly simple with only one rom chip and one ram chip. This makes the conversion easy since only one chip will have to be replaced. I popped the famicom game open (easier said than done!) and desoldered the ROM chip. Then I got the equivalent EPROM chip and flashed it with the English version of the game. Unfortunately the stander Mask ROM the cartridge uses isn’t pin compatible with a standard EPROM so a few legs of the chip needed to be lifted and rerouted to other ports on the PCB. Luckily only about 3 pins need to be changed. Pop it in and solder it up and I was in business! It’s been kind of a dream of mine to do this some day so I was pretty excited to see it worked. I can’t wait to do more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty: Desoldering chips isn’t super fun…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustration: Skipping lunch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payoff: Years of waiting and wishing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall Project: A really nice learning experience&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Android Wear/Moto 360 Review</title>
   <link href="http://catskull.net/reviews/2015/04/28/android-wear-moto-360-review/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-28T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://catskull.net/reviews/2015/04/28/android-wear-moto-360-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: Below is a wall of rambling and poorly worded text. Don’t judge me TOO much…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just over a year ago, Google unveiled Android Wear, their version of Android specifically tailored for so-called “smart watches” or “wearables”. Among the first devices announced was the Moto 360. As the name implies, it was extremely notable due to it’s completely round display - something almost completely unheard of at the time (and even extremely uncommon today). Though the first two Android Wear devices launched on June 25, 2014 at Google’s I/O, the much anticipated Moto 360 wouldn’t be available until September 5. It seemed somewhat odd that the flagship smart watch wouldn’t be the first to arrive. It was announced at that same I/O that “everyone [there] whould receive their own Moto 360……when they are available…” Why wouldn’t Google just give everyone an LG G watch, since they were already available? The world may never know. That detail isn’t really the point of this post though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial reaction to the announcement was excitement. It came before the Apple Watch was official in any way, so it was really the first of it’s kind. Sure there were things like the pebble and whatever samsung was scamming people into buying, but a major competitor backing their own OS was exciting thing. Developers would enjoy a very similar experience to what they were used to on normal Android (much the same way iOS developers were greeted by the Apple Watch tools). It seemed like an answer to an idea people have dreamt about for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement video had some examples of people using it. There were a lot of people biking. That was my first problem, I don’t bike. Like, ever. Still though, I could use it….driving? Yeah, I could use it driving, I reassured myself. They did things like open a garage by speaking to their watch using the familiar Google Now catchphrase “Ok, Google”. I was and still am a huge user of Google Now so I found that very exciting. I could have Google Now on my wrist at all times! But how did they open the garage? Does Android Wear come with the ability to integrate with all existing garage door openers? (As a side note, I would go on to develop my own IoT garage door opener, though we never made an Android Wear app and I never had a garage.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrqZl2QIz0c&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching the video a second (or third, or fourth) time, my excitment began to wain. Literally every single one of the examples they used were people doing things that I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; did. Catching a plane, riding on a bus, giving kids a bath, surfing, &lt;em&gt;literally dancing to Chromeo while waiting in a long line&lt;/em&gt;. Chromeo for heavens sake! Google either seriously over-estimated the average consumer, or they were genius in believing they could convince the average consumer that they were cool enough that they did all these things. And lets face it, if I were ever caught riding on a bus, I would be already staring at my phone! If by some miracle I was not, I &lt;em&gt;definately&lt;/em&gt; would not be comfortable replying to a text with my voice, out loud, on a crowded bus. Now way, Jose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what would &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; do with a smart watch? I sit at a desk for 8 hours a day, drive home, and sit on a couch for the other 4-5 before going to bed. Now remember, I do use Google Now extensively, but all of the times I do, it is not inconvenient to take a phone out of my pocket. I don’t use Google Now while running down the street, raking leaves, or grocery shopping. Well, take that back, I use it grocery shopping when I’m trying to find out which song they’re playing on the radio (it’s always Fleetwood Mac). I use Google Now when I’m hanging out with my wife or friends and someone says “Which president built Mount Rushmore anyways?” It’s easier to whip my phone out, and from the lock screen say “Ok Google, which president built Mount Rushmore?” I also feel like it’s more conversational as well, as I don’t actually have to be looking at the screen while I’m doing any of those things. I can still be visually participating in a conversation. I do have to look at the phone once the result comes in, but that’s &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; conversational because I read it out loud, to everyone. It works very well. Doing any of this on a watch would not be any more or less convenient. But hey, it would definatly be cooler, right? Mr. James Bond over here figuring out how deep the mariana trench is by a simple voice command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was never really into watches either as a means for telling time or as an accessory. I have small girly wrists, so anything big or heavy is annoying to me. I had a Casio Calculator watch for a while though, and that was okay. Suffice to say I’m not really a watch persion. That was the first nail in the coffin, thinking back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I remember telling myself I would be willing to try an Android Wear device if the price point was ~$100. The Moto 360 was announced for $249 and the LG G watch was $189. So that’s wear my willingness to try and adopt this technology came to a screeching halt. Since then, I’ve tentatively watched as the platform evolved and as a few more devices came along. All of them were still out of my price range. And with every review I still had an unanswered question: What does it actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;? More importantly, what would &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; do with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This progressed for about a year. The Apple Watch was announced to fanfair. I was impressed that people were so excited about it, given it’s cost. It reinforced my suspision that a man will buy anything at any price as long as it’s “cool” enough, and a woman will buy anything at any price as long as it’s “cute” enough. Now that I think about it though, I don’t actually know any women personally who own an Apple Watch. I guess Beyonce has a gold one that’s literally not possible to buy, but she’s not even a real person anyways right? After saying that I half expect Kanye to commandeer my keyboard! I think I’m safe though…&lt;/p&gt;

Image courtesy of my friend C. Simmons Campbell. Check out his work &lt;a href=&quot;http://cscdesign.co/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, my first real interaction with wearables was indeed the Apple Watch. I just happened to be near an Apple store and had time to kill, so I wandered in to take a peek. I tapped the screen, twisted the wheel, pressed both buttons, and left having absolutely no idea what it actually did, or how someone would actually use it. It was definately cool though. In a way, it was remeniscint of the obelisk from Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Oddesey, where I was a monkey and the Apple Watch was the mysterioius obelesk. I’d love to say that upon touching it for the first time I started screeching, or was enlightened into the next plane of existance, but I didn’t and I wasn’t. Then looking at the price tag and having a mini heart attack for even touching something so expensive, I felt alone and fearful. I actually found the display unit more interesting than the watch itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was before the Apple Watch was available for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after, it came out and a few friends started posting about it. It became a humorous habit of mine to exclaim “Wow, an iWatch! What does it do?” and listen to cobbled together responeses about how it’s nice to not have to pull out their &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; iPhone 6/6+ (how ironic) any time they wanted to do something like check the weather. On the surface, the answer to that question seemed to be “Basically the same thing as my phone, but different and on my wrist” but deeper down the answer was almost dark: “I don’t really know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was then I decided I must finally discover what one actually did with a smart watch. I resolved I must purchase a device and use it for maybe a week, in both extreme situations. On a vacation where I would be up and about in unfamiliar places needing constant directions and travel tips, and at my desk doing the same thing I did every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I purchased a Moto 360 for $249.99, but not before expliclity going over the return policy with the cashier. I really actually wanted an LG G watch since they’re a little smaller (and cheaper). They only had white/gold in stock though. So I ended up with the straight black Moto 360. I was actually pretty excited! I love all tech and gadgets, but more importantly I like tools that make my life easier or extend my (limited) abilities. You could say I enjoy checking out power drills as much as I do playing with the newest tablets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got back the our hotel room and I was eager to unbox it. I’ll simply state the packaging was nice enough. It comes in a clever little round box. I busted it out, along with the charger stand and cable. Interestingly, it didn’t come with a usb wall adapter and a seperate micro USB cable, it was all connected into one unit. The cable is plugged into the charging stand. The charging stand itself is actually kind of cool, you just set it on there and it charges by induction. There’s no magnet or anything to hold it in place, but it’s on a slight angle so if you had it on your desk or bedside it is easily viewable as a normal clock. That was actually the first thing I tried to do with it - plug it in. Doing that acheived nothing however, so a quick manual consultation told me to hold the only button down for a few seconds. Then, it showed the first signs of life. Again, not entirely unlike the aforementioned obelisk, it felt like magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few motorola logos and some snazzy boot animations, I was prompted to install the Android Wear app on my phone. After that I synced them together and I was off! There was a quick demo that I just kinda blazed through. The best way to describe the system is like Google Now with a clock. It functions literally the exact same way. A bunch of potentially useful “cards” show up in a stack. Things like pacakge shipments, weather, and appointment reminders show up. It works as well as Google Now, which is to say impressively well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really like (slash never really learned how to read very well) analog clocks, so I switched the watchface out for one of the other preloaded ones. It’s important to note that the Moto 360 has &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; digital watchface preinstalled. In hindsight, it makes sense since this is uniquely round. All of the preloaded watchfaces are customizable to some extent, but to do anything you have to get another app on your phone, one the motorola made for cutomizing the watch. That was a little annoying to me, but whatever, it’s not anything new. I only tried it on one watchface, but I was able to customize the color of the digits as well as choosing white or black for the background. It worked decently well, but more importantly it whispered into my ear a long held suspiscion of mind: you can’t do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; on the watch itself. Sure, you can change which watchface you use, but you can’t change the way the watchface looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long tap on the watchface itself lets you change the watch face. A short tap on the top part brings up a kind of menu or launcher that lets you chose from some default actions like navigations or setting a stopwatch. More than anything, it was just a list of example commands you could give Google Now. Ad the very bottom of the list, below even settings, is a “Start” option that shows all of the apps you have installed. Again though, this is really more an example of a command. For example, I can say “Ok Google, start USAA” and it will start the USAA app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the term app somewhat liberally here. There’s no real way to install an app on the device itself. Instead you install apps on your phone and certain apps also have some kind of limited watch functionality. For example the USAA app asks me for my pin and then shows me a list my accounts and their balances card style. Now hey, that actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; kind of convenient! I can check my bank accounts with exactly 4 taps and one voice command as opposed to probably 4x that amount on the Android app itself. That may be more a flaw in the app design but &lt;em&gt;I want to believe!&lt;/em&gt; What’s interesting is that there are some standalone ‘apps’ that will only function on the watch, mostly watch faces. You still have to install them on your phone, but there’s no way to tell from your phone which ones you have installed. I had to go into my settings and view all the apps installed on my phone till I noticed one that I had tried out and then abandoned. Uninstalling the Android Wear app won’t automatically uninstall watchfaces either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Ok, Google” voice command detection works surprisingly well, but I wish I got a vibration feedback to let me know it was ready for a command. I’m convinced that the times this will be most useful will be when I’m not actually looking at the watch. Which brings up another point, the vibration is just a litle “meh”. It’s definately noticable, but I could also see myself missing it because it’s too subtle. Maybe that’s actually a feature though? It would be nice to not be distracted by this device when doing something important or intense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to go back to the hardware breifly. As I mentioned, I’m not a watch person due to my girly small wrists. My wife ways the watch looks good on me, but it feels a bit heavy and bulky. It’s definatley nice though. The leather band is nothing out of this world, but it exactly what I want. A metal band would be unconfortable for me. The watch feels a bit thick, though I haven’t been able to compare that to any other watches so as far as I know that’s par for the course. The most interesting part for me is the glass on top. It seems thick, or that the screen is somehow far behind it. I’m not sure if the LCD is laminated to the glass or not. I’d venture a guess that it is, but that the glass is just thicker than on your average smartphone. Somehow the screen feels magnifyed by the glass, making me feel like I’m peering into a crystal ball. That effect may come from the rounded corners of the glass. If the screen is 50mm in diameter, the glass is 49mm and then 1mm of the rounded portion. You might think that the glass would be slightly larger than the screen, however in this configuration it creates an almost “endless pool” illusion in a way. Overall, I think I like that, though I don’t know what it would look like the other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest flaw in the display is the portion at the bottom. There’s just a little black bar where they crammed the display driver. I mean, it’s got to go somewhere right? I can’t help but think the 360 theme would look so much better if it didn’t cost you screen space. I’d put money to say that the next version will eliminate that. The only other round watch, the LG G watch R solves this by just increasing the bezel around the screen. That would be unacceptable for me, making a watch that already feels big bigger is just not worth it. Still, it left me wishing for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The display itself is on the low res side. It’s a 320 x 290 screen. Compare that to the 312 x 390 for the 42mm Apple Watch and it doesn’t look bad on paper. I can’t speack much for how the Apple Watch screen looks in person, but I don’t remember it looking exceptionally low res. Maybe I’ve been spoiled by literally every other device I own, but looking at the watch face for the first time I was taken aback at how low res it looked. Even if I am spoiled, it just goes to show that a pixel density that low doesn’t cut it in this day and age. That will inevitably be solved someday, likely very soon. Don’t get me wrong, it doesn’t by any means look particularly bad, it’s just not great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day using the watch had it’s ups and downs. Like I said before, I would be using this on a day that I would be more reliant on my phone than usual. I mostly needed help navigating, but on top of that I’d be doing all of my normal phone stuff: checking email, texts, social media, etc. The first time I raised the watch and said “Okay Google, navigate to…” it was a thrilling experience. I actually really enjoyed having it while driving as well. My phone would chime in with the next direction, and my wrist would vibrate and show a mini map of what I was going to be doing. Also at any time I could glance at the watch and see the same thing. I liked that because I often find myself wanting to peek at what the next direction will be and finagaling with a phone while driving can be &lt;s&gt;distracting&lt;/s&gt; dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should go without saying that the watch has a maximum potential usefulness as your phone does. If your phone is dead, the watch might as well not exist. I guess it can still technically tell the time, but that’s about it. With the moto 360 you probably won’t have to worry about that ever happening though. We left our hotel at about 11 am and by 3 pm it was at 9% battery. Now, I’ve owned both the Nexus 4 and 5 and despite constant complaints of poor battery life I’ve never been too disappointed by it. But 4 hours of use? Are you kidding me? That’s totally unacceptable. I don’t know what would constitute heavy use on a smart watch, but I just can’t believe naviagation falls into that category. And again, the watch screen is not on 100% of the time while navigating. It’s on maybe 10% of the time. So I have no idea what in the world could be draining the battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charging isn’t particularly fast either. It’s within my due dilligence to actually time it, but I’d guess that it takes maybe 2 hours to go from 0 to 100. Another note is that because the charger itself doesn’t actually connect to the watch in any way, it’s nearly impossible to charge it on the go. I carry a portable battery that I use frequently, and it would be nice to be able to plug the watch in, throw it in my pack and forget about it. But the watch has to be perfectly positioned on the charging stand at all times. I ended up holding the watch on the charging stand while my wife was driving. Pathetic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best way I can describe the functionality of Android Wear is an external display for your phone that only shows you notifications. So really you just have to decide for yourself how helpful that might be. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; interact with the notifications, albeit in a limited way. Essentially you get the exact same level of interaction that you get in the notifications dropdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the watch while I wasn’t on the road was a little better, and a little worse. I got significantly better battery life. I could easily make it all day with 50% left. However, the reason for the improved battery life was clear: I never used it! Honestly, I get very few notifications throuought the day. I found that if I cross my arms with one arm on top of the watch, it turns on and starts wreaking all sorts of havoc. The times that I legitimately wanted to use it, it just didn’t work that well. I tried setting a timer for 36 minutes and rather than doing just that, I was prompted to chose a timer in 15 minute intervals. Since that makes a ton of sense? And even more bizarre, after that prompt I was asked to chose a time of day. I have no idea what that did though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another gripe I have with the software is that it shows you what I guess is a preview of your most recent notification. I think this is mostly a “feature” of the moto 360 specifically, but it keeps telling me how many steps I’ve taken today. I guess that’s kind of nice, but I don’t want to see it ALL THE TIME. I’d love to be able to just ask Google Now whenever I wanted that that information. I found a setting to disable notifications from that “app” but that did not disable the step counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that really that is my overall feeling about the Moto 360 and presumably Android Wear in general. Definately some cool tech, but it does too little where it should do more, it tries to do too much where it should do less. Overall it just didn’t really feel that great. When I bought the Moto 360, I had no intention of keeping it beyond the 30 day return policy. Secretly I hoped that something would catch and I’d really fall in love with it, but that just didn’t happen. I took it back early with no regrets. You could certainly argue that I already made up my mind before I even took the watch out of the box, but I really tried to take it for what it was. At the end of the day it’s a really cool peice of technology that just doesn’t really function that well. I’m hopeful that in future hardware and software updates the mechnaics of what could make a smart watch really useful will get tuned in, but at this point I’m not holding my breath.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Interview: My Technical Interview That's Almost as Funny as a Seth Rogan Movie</title>
   <link href="http://catskull.net/general/2015/04/16/how-to-fail-a-job-interview/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://catskull.net/general/2015/04/16/how-to-fail-a-job-interview</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been mulling over whether it would be productive to write this experience down or not. I ultimately came to the conclusion that it would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be productive. However, I am currently cramming for finals and cannot make myself study any more. So I figure writing this would be more productive than just refreshing my email over and over for the next two hours. Full disclosure: I don’t really have any valuable tips to give someone in a technical interview. Hopefully at least I can be an example of what not to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Feb. 2013. I had just returned home from a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon). The only reason this is important is because I basically hadn’t touched a computer in two years. At least not in a programming/technical way. Not that I was very technical before that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My uncle is a very successful and smart engineer/developer. He has a long list of valid credentials. He phoned me telling me a company he worked for was looking for a Linux server admin and he had remembered that I had played with Linux in the past. Since he was going to be doing the hiring and training, he figured I should apply and he would get me up to speed. Well, that was mistake number one: he overestimated my learning ability. Not only that, but in hindsight I have basically no interest in sysadmin stuff. I don’t now and I probably didn’t then either. But I didn’t really have anything going on, so I figured why not? It would pay well, and give me at least some experience to keep going into the CS field, to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we did was get together and prepare my resume. This consisted essentially of us changing the name on his resume and changing the names of the places he’d worked to places I’d worked. I can see now that this was just a formality, since he would really be doing the hiring and training. I didn’t realize that at the time. Then we went through a list of technologies and skills on his resume and cut out the ones I didn’t know. I say didn’t know, but really it was more like things I’d never heard of. Bash? Sure, heard of that. SSH? Yeah I think I had to do that once. A bunch of that kind of thing. Do I really know &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; about bash? Absolutely not! At the time I doubt I could have even told you what it was!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways fast forward down the line, I had a job offer. I was supposed to move out to where the job was located (not anywhere close to a place I’d ever lived or been). One day, I told my brother “I really don’t want to move out there and do this job.” He told me: “Then don’t.” So that’s what I did, I bailed. It just didn’t feel right, and rightly so, I can’t even comprehend what it would have been like to get out there and realize how deep I was in over my head, but at the same time feeling like there was no way out. That would have &lt;em&gt;sucked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important part here is that I now had a) a job offer and b) a resume that I thought had got me the job offer. The most important part about a job is getting it, right? I have no clue if I had even considered what would happen when I show up day one and have absolutely no idea what’s going on. I never thought that far ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sort of long term goal was to end up out in Utah, and I would be visiting there soon so I decided to look for Linux server admin jobs in Utah on monster. And what luck! I found one! So I fired them off “my” resume and we set up an interview while I would be out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should mention here something that I comfort myself with at night when I think about this experience and want to crawl out of my skin. I have to find some way to shift some of the guilt of this off of me, and this is what I tell myself. I did not lie about my education on my resume. I put exactly what I had: a high school diploma. Now who in their right mind would ever believe that someone who graduated high school less than 5 years ago, and had been on an LDS mission for two of those, was some kind of Linux guru master? They must have thought I was a prodigy. Sure, they exist . High school kids doing &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt; things. I was never one of those kids though. So it was their fault I was even let into the building! Right? Right? Well…that’s what I tell myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting some feedback on this story, I feel like there is something I should reinforce here. As inexplicable as it may be, I was not aware at this time that I had lied on a resume or that I was even underqualified for this job. Again, someone that I trusted both personally and professionally was okay with what I claimed on my resume. Think about giving your 5 year old the keys to your car. Your child trusts you completely. You’re in the passenger seat, your child is driving. You’re driving down the road, banging into every car along the way. The whole time you’re cheering your kid on “You’re doing great! Great job! You’re an excellent driver!”. At this point, what kind of driver do you think your child thinks they are? They probably believed you when you told them they were an excellent driver, right? If someone else were to ask them what kind of driver they are, your kid would probably just repeat what you had told them, right? That may be a bad example, but that’s the best way I can explain how oblivious I was. I was 22. I should have known better. As hard as it may be to believe, I just didn’t. I don’t know what else I can say. Moving on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can clearly see, I had totally set myself up for failure. Again, I really had no idea what to expect. I hear the term “unknown unknowns” often, to describe something you’re not even aware that you don’t know. I would say that was exactly my experience here. I had &lt;em&gt;no idea&lt;/em&gt; what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day comes for the interview. I put on my best suit and showed up. “Woah, this is big”, was the first thought when I arrived. I mean, I expected some shop in the corner of an industrial park to be interviewed by maybe some owner/manager that also had no clue about devops. Nope. It was a real, legitimate company, with a huge nice building. The reception area was kind of like an airport terminal, so there was a long desk on the end where multiple receptionists were seated. I walked up to one that wasn’t busy and told him who I was and what I was there for. He said something like “Great, I’ll let them know you’re here.” I happened to spot that he had a Nexus 4 on his desk, and I had just bought one myself and was super stoked about it. That was the first Nexus 4 I had seen in the wild. So I showed him mine and said “Woah, Nexus 4! Nice dude! How do you like it?” He responded with some kind of disinterested “Yeah, it’s great, whatever, you can sit over there while you’re waiting.” Well that guy came across as kind of a dick, but whatever, maybe he was just having a rough day. What he was actually probably thinking was “Who the freak is this kid, interviewing for a job making 80k plus a year?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the guy that’s running the interview shows up and we do the formalities. Then he takes me up to what was basically a server room. I say up, I can’t remember exactly how many stories because we rode in the elevator. I would guess we went up two stories to maybe the third floor? And this whole building was just this company. So again, it’s a huge, real, professional company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we get to the server room, two other guys walk into the room. One is kind of a network guy, and the other is a Linux guy (he was literally wearing a Slackware t-shirt). The guy that took me up there was some kind of project manager from what I could tell. I can’t remember what exactly went on. I think we went over my resume because one question in particular sticks out that makes me want to crawl under a rock and never come out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, you know bash?”, the Linux guy asks. “Yeah!” I respond cheerfully. “What have you written in bash then?” This is significant, because it was the first time I had even considered this question. What &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; I written in bash? I do know what bash is, right? The best response I can come up with was “I don’t remember.” I DON’T REMEMBER!?!?! Are you kidding me? Again, this is something that I comfort myself with. At that point, the interview should have ended. 5 minutes in. I should have been scolded briefly for wasting their time and for falsifying my resume. But nope, they kept on going. Maybe they were enjoying it? The looks on their faces said otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After going over the fake resume, we transitioned into kind of a question-answer quiz thing. First up was the network guy. I estimate that we spent maybe 5 mintues going back and forth with questions and answers. I have no idea what he was asking me, I didn’t at the time either. TCP something, UDP bla bla bla. HTTP FTP something something. I have no idea what my answers could have been. Maybe I’ve subconsciously blocked them out as a survival tactic. I do remember answering “I don’t know” to some of them, which I have to give myself credit for. I’ve heard of technical interview tactics where they try to get to a point where the candidate doesn’t know the answer to their questions, as a way to test if they’re capable of admitting that they don’t know something. I’m huge on that- the first step in learning something is recognizing you don’t know it right? Never be afraid to admit you don’t know something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going on now, we transition to the Linux guy. He does the same question-answer thing, for about the same amount of time. I think I might have done a little better on this one. What that actually means is that I answered a lot less of his questions “I don’t know”. I would bet that I was able to answer about the same amount of questions correctly though, there were just more that I could at least fathom a guess and answer. This guy in particular sticks out to me because his face grew more and more distressed as we went on. By the end he was frowning and pretty much just barking his questions out. It was as if I was killing him. I guess maybe that’s humorous in hind sight. Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of these two QA sessions, one thing was explicitly clear to me: I had &lt;em&gt;NO&lt;/em&gt; idea what I was doing there. I should have run out of that building right then and there! But I didn’t, because I was and am, an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manager guy pipes up, telling me that there was a 3rd phase of the technical interview. I was to configure a CentOS server. He phrased his question something like “Do you think you feel comfortable trying the server part?” but what he was really trying to give me the hint to take his mercy and get the heck out of there. I did not. Again, I comfort myself by questioning why he wouldn’t have just ended the interview there. Why did he even give me a shot? His fault, not mine. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They put me in front of a screen and a keyboard. Note that a mouse was not involved. It was literally just a command line for a CentOS machine. Maybe you’re laughing at this. I had definitely used the command line before, at least enough to know about vim. This part of the interview I have the hardest time remembering. I think at this point I was surviving on pure instinct, like a bug running away from a shoe. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the Linux guy handed me a sheet of instructions, on a piece of paper. There were maybe 10 steps I was supposed to do? I can’t remember what any of those steps were however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and now that I’m thinking about it, I had access to another computer that was a full GUI system and I was allowed to use Google on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I &lt;s&gt;spend&lt;/s&gt; waste another 20 minutes of their time googling step by step each one of their instructions. They just sat silently in awe behind me. It was horrible, I can’t imagine the looks they were shooting each other. The only thing I remember about this part was I had to edit a file, so I fired up vim. The only problem was that I had no idea how to use vim. I think I literally googled “how to use vim” and figured out how to at least get into insert mode. I couldn’t figure out how to exit insert mode and save/quit though. I started typing “how to exit vim” into Google but the Linux guy shouted “escape, colon, w, q!”. And yes, I had to google that to even write this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I might have actually finished the server part? I can’t remember, but I’m pretty sure I didn’t just give up. I swiveled around in my chair and tried my best to smile. I said something like “that’s what I love, just figuring stuff out and learning” as a way to maybe justify how bad I sucked? I mean, what else was I supposed to say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then just like that, the interview was over. They did ask me one last question though: “Are you okay to travel?” I can’t believe they didn’t just burst out with laughter at that. Even the suggestion that I was a viable candidate was laughable by then, I’m even chuckling to myself now thinking about it. Just really, the icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said goodbye to networking and Linux guys and manager guy escorted my back to the lobby. I remember talking to him about how cool I thought Chrome OS was (it was still kinda new at that point). Why I brought up Chrome OS is beyond me. I’m pretty sure I also showed him my Nexus 4. To give him credit, he was nice. Nicer than networking guy and a lot nicer than Linux guy. My theory is that he’s the reason the interview went on. He must have been superior in hierarchy to networking and Linux guys, and he was probably too nice to end the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got back down to the lobby where it all began, he told me he’d let me know on Monday what they had decided, and it was over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I did not hear back from them on Monday. Not a decline, not an offer, just nothing. Usually that pisses me off because clearly there’s a reason you didn’t get the job and how can you improve if you don’t know what you did wrong, but this was more like a “go get a degree in IT and come back in four years” thing. It wasn’t in the realm of “you kept picking your nose in the interview” or “another candidate has foreign language experience.” No amount of feedback could have helped me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve thought about that interview a lot over the past 2-3 years, however long it’s been. I’ve gotten jobs with a real resume. I’ve worked at a car wash, in retail sales, web development. I got all those jobs with a real resume. I don’t have a ton of regrets about the interview itself. It may sound crazy, but given my level of skill and capability, I think I actually interviewed pretty well. Obviously I regret faking a resume, but in my defense I didn’t really know I was faking it. Again, that sounds insane, but if someone who does know something tells you you know it too, you believe them. At least I did. And I can’t throw my Uncle under the bus too much, he didn’t intend for me to actually use this resume in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s really all there is to say. Don’t fake your resume, kids. I remember when I was a kid my friends brother told me he could jump over my house. I believed him at first, but when I asked to see a demonstration it was clear that he could not. You have nothing to gain by lying. It’s okay if you don’t know everything. I can promise you this: if you lie on your resume and get the job, you’ll be miserable. And if you’re not, lying on a resume isn’t the extent of your problems.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How To: Completely Erase the ROM of an EMS 64m USB Gameboy Cart</title>
   <link href="http://catskull.net/gameboy/hack/2015/04/14/erase-an-ems-64-usb-gameboy-cart/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-14T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://catskull.net/gameboy/hack/2015/04/14/erase-an-ems-64-usb-gameboy-cart</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;disclaimer-i-am-not-an-expert-in-gameboy-hardware-to-any-extent-so-take-this-with-a-grain-of-salt&quot;&gt;Disclaimer: I am not an expert in Gameboy hardware to any extent, so take this with a grain of salt.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 1: I neglected to mention there is an app for Android that will allow you to flash the cart using a USB OTG cable. I haven’t used that app, but it may be easier for some people than a command line unix utility. It looks like it only supports reading/writing savs though? Find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shiftfypixlz.aread.emsflasher&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2: I also neglected to mention that talented hacker MottZilla wrote (patched?) a menu app for Windows that lets you do multi rom and also have multiple savs. I haven’t used that either but it may be worth checking out. You can find his write up &lt;a href=&quot;http://thegaminguniverse.org/ninjagaiden4/mottzilla/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been playing around with my EMS 64m USB gabmeboy cartridge. The cart itself works well for what it is, but the flashing software is completely lacking. It’s Windows only, and that’s if you’re even able to get the drivers installed (which is basically impossible). The cart has two “pages” each 32mbit for a total of 64. It changes between the two pages with a ghetto power cycle. Basically it just has a little capacitor that gets charged when the gameboy is on, and if the cap still has a charge when the cartridge is booted it goes to page 2. This works pretty well for getting from page 1 to page 2, but getting from page 2 back to 1 is a hassle because you just have to wait for the capacitor to discharge. That makes me wonder how hard it would be to replace the capacitor with a switch or button of some kind, but that’s beyond the scope of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting drawback to the cart is that it can only support one sav at a time. In other words, if you had Pokemon Blue on page 1, and Pokemon Gold on page 2, you could only keep one save for each at a time. Save in Blue, then switch to Gold and save and guess what? Your blue save is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The windows flashing utility that ships with the cart has support for multi rom. I don’t know the intricacies of it, but basically it just patches all the roms you give it into one big rom, and then throws on a custom menu rom they made. &lt;s&gt;So the short story is that the cart itself is &quot;dumb&quot;, and their patched multirom menu could be used just as well on almost any flash cart.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;em&gt;This is incorrect.&lt;/em&gt; Thanks to nitro2k01 for pointing out the mistakes. There are special properties of the EMS cart that will only allow their menu rom to work on and EMS cart. For a more in depth explanation, visit his writup &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.gg8.se/wordpress/2013/03/04/gameboy-project-week-9-the-ems-cartridges-something-old-and-something-new-something-black-and-something-blue-and-how-sloppy-cartridge-design-affects-you/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the wackyness of switching pages, usually I just like to put the exact same roms on both pages, so I don’t have to deal with it. I mean, how many roms could you possibly want on the same cart, especialy given the limited sav space? So I have LSDJ as my “main” rom (intended for use saves), and then a bunch of non-save roms (like tetris).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Mike Ryan wrote a command-line driver for *nix systems. You can find more information about that &lt;a href=&quot;http://lacklustre.net/projects/ems-flasher/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It works extremely well and is ultra reliable. The one caveat is that it does not support multi rom. It can write to both pages, but only one rom on each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talented “Gameboy Genius” nitro2k01 has been working on a file manager called LittleFM for LSDJ for some time. The goal is to add better song management to LSDJ, as well as other cool features like the ability to transfer songs over a link cable. He achieved this by writing a rom that is then patched onto the LSDJ rom. So rather then booting straight to LSDJ, you’re greeted by his file manager that can then load a song and boot into LSDJ. As an experiment he wrote a multi rom menu specifically for the EMS cart. It’s a dirty hack; you have to manually append the roms you want to the patched LSDJ rom with a tool like cat on Unix or copy on Windows. The end result is one large gameboy rom with LSDJ, the file manager, and your other roms all nicely tucked into one big rom. More information about that can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.gg8.se/wordpress/2013/02/04/gameboy-project-week-5-littlefm-05-finally-released/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Now we have a nice multi rom image ready to flash with Mike Ryan’s custom *nix driver!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is where the blog post gets on topic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one issue is that it appears that the *nix driver only overwrites the sectors of the of the memory that it needs to. Say you’re flashing an 8 megabit rom, it will only overwrite the first 8 megabits of the memory. This is normal operation for memory writing. Deleting a file on your computer doesn’t actually delete it, it just tells the system that space can now be safely overwritten. The issue comes from how nitro2k01’s multi rom menu works. From my understanding it just looks for any other rom headers in the memory. But what happens if you flash a multi rom image that takes up all the memory, but then later decide that you don’t want all those roms and flash a smaller rom, the other roms will still show up in the menu because they haven’t actually been overwritten! If I’m not explaining this very well, just let met know. I will include pictures below as well for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked up a solution to this that’s extremely simple. If you’re reformatting a drive on your computer and want to make sure none of the files can be recovered, you have to not only reformat the drive, but overwrite all data with 0’s or something like that. Knowning that, I fired up my hex editor and wrote a file that’s 32 mbit in size and contains only 0’s. Then I wrote that to my cart. I booted it up to make sure everything was gone, and then re-wrote my multi rom. And just like that, all the old roms were gone, and only the new ones were there!
After the fact, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jazz-disassemblies.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Jordan Appleton-Joslin&lt;/a&gt; recommended writing all 1’s instead of 0’s. Something to do with a detail that it’s quicker for the rom to overwrite a 1 than it is to overwrite a 0. A little bit beyond my understanding. The download now links to a rom that contains only 1’s. Thanks Jordan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To expand on this, it would be nice to contribute more to the *nix driver to include either support for writing to specific locations or for multi rom support out of the box. Unfortunately my C driver coding skills are nonexistent so that’s not happening any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/uxE5nU&quot;&gt;The blank rom can be downloaded here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/ems/badrom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bad rom! I don&#39;t want all of those!&quot; /&gt;
I only want the top two roms to show up in the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/ems/blank.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blank&quot; /&gt;
Just what I want, a totally blank rom!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/ems/goodrom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Good rom!&quot; /&gt;
The payoff, after re flashing the multi rom image, only to two that I want are there!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Building an Ambient Red Light For the Nursery</title>
   <link href="http://catskull.net/baby/projects/2015/04/09/baby-nursery-red-light/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-09T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://catskull.net/baby/projects/2015/04/09/baby-nursery-red-light</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;15 MINUTE PROJECT!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: Our baby is due in like a month. Crazy. Anticipating the countless hours spent in the nursery in the middle of the night, I wanted some kind of light that would be a little bit easier on the eyes in the middle of the night. I remembered learning that red light travels at a longer wavelength than other colors, so that’s good to use at night because your eyes don’t adjust to it as much. Thanks to Radio Shack going out of business, I picked up a 5 ft roll of red leds for cheap. I figured, why don’t I just go ahead and make a nightlight? It was pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details: The led roll runs off of 12v DC. That’s a fairly common voltage, so I had an adapter laying around. I ordered some panel mount barrel connectors to fit the power adapter. I also ordered some handly little switches that have a power indicator led built into them. They are designed to be used in a car, so the led needs 12v also. You could use the switch for any voltage, but it must be 12v for the led to turn on. The last thing was just a cheap project box. All of these were bought off eBay for a total of around $10. Soldering it up was pretty straightforward, as was drilling the appropriate holes in the enclosure. I mounted the enclosure to the side of our changing table so I could run the led strip behind it to diffuse the bright leds a little bit. Have you ever had an led shining straight into your eye? Not fun, no matter what color it is. The only thing left was a little bit of hot glue to secure the led strip in place, and I was in business. Overall, I’m pretty happy with the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty: One poopy diaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustration: One stinky diaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payoff: A sleeping little babe (and wife!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall project: A lot easier than having a baby, that’s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/baby/switch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Switch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Slow Down, for Productivity's Sake</title>
   <link href="http://catskull.net/general/programming/2015/03/22/slow-down-and-save-yourselves/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://catskull.net/general/programming/2015/03/22/slow-down-and-save-yourselves</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, my brother and I were working on a programming project. It was a pretty fun one too, so we were immediately sucked in. We started at about 4:30 PM and within probably an hour we had all the framework built out and the only thing left was the “hard part”. Fast forward to about 8 PM. We were stuck dead in our tracks on the “hard part”. Try as we might, there was just no way we could figure out a way to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, a thought occurred to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in the past full time professionally doing rails development I would often get distracted, even for stretches of 10 to 15 minutes. Whether it was watching a video on youtube, reading an article online, or just chatting with a coworker about something non work related, it would happen. I would estimate that for each hour I was at work, this would occur at least once. Often I would feel extremely guilty for being at work, getting paid, and not really working. I’m sure any manager out there reading this is currently looking up my previous employers to convince them to sue me. Just bear with me while I attempt to get my point across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span&quot;&gt;wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; on attention span suggests that the average healthy adult can focus on one thing for anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes. The argument could certainly be made that programming doesn’t involve just focusing on one thing, but rather many different thinks and multitasking. However, I tend to view any given project to be one whole thing one would focus their attention on (i.e., wether you’re digging the post holes or painting it, at the end of the day you’ve still &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; been building a fence all day). The wikipedia article doesn’t go into details about what usually happens when an adult tries to focus on something &lt;em&gt;longer&lt;/em&gt; than their attention span, but I have some thoughts to share from my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider that if I am focusing on my work for 100% of the time I am at work, I would also be 100% productive. However, the facts show that this is virtually impossible for any normal human adult. So let’s say, and this is an extreme estimation, that I am only focusing on my work for half the time I’m at work. In other words, hypothetically, I’m only 50% productive. So I get only 4 hours of work done in a given 8 hour period. Ideally, I’d be able to be 100% productive. But in reality, I’d get to work, be 100% effective for &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; the first 3 hours, and by 11 AM I’d be completely burnt out and probably wouldn’t be able to work much more for the rest of the day. So I would get 3 hours of work done in an 8 hour period. Granted that my examples or exaggerated and extreme, but I think the point is still solid. &lt;em&gt;I’m better off working slowly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s jump back to my brother and I scratching our heads with impossibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had been focusing 100% of our attention on our project for about 3 and 1/2 hours. Or 1000% of our maximum attention span of 20 minutes. In order to proceed on the project, we shut the computer off, went to dinner, and didn’t think or talk about the project until the next day. In other words, &lt;em&gt;we were sick of our project&lt;/em&gt;. At that 8 PM mark if you would have given me the option to take a bullet to the foot and never have to think about the project again, or being forced to work on it for another 30 minutes, I would have seriously considered taking the bullet. Can you imagine if I’d been at work, getting paid, and had a manager bearing down on me to get the project finished &lt;em&gt;that day&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;? Why were we to burned out? Remember, this was initially something we had found “fun”! Why would I prefer to get shot rather than working on something I considered entertaining? A possible theory was that the project just didn’t have enough “fun” in it to last that long. I would argue against that because upon resuming the project the next day, I again found it to be “fun”. I think really the only reason is that I just didn’t have the mental capacity to focus on a task for that long. &lt;em&gt;I needed to take a break.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all read time and again articles that say you should spend x amount of time doing something else for every y amount of time you’re working on the computer. “Stand for every 10 minutes of sitting down.” I tend to be a believer in those recommendations, for the most part. Of course, the implementation proves to be exponentially more difficult than the discovery. And I think really, at the end of the day, it’s all the same thing: &lt;strong&gt;SLOW DOWN&lt;/strong&gt;. Take a break. Relax. Go show a coworker a youtube video. Read an article unrelated to work. For heaven’s sake, go take a short walk outside. Because if you’re anything like I am, it will be for your own good. You will become more productive, reduce stress, drastically limit burnout, and be generally a happier and more effective person in general.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been blogging in various forms for at least the last 5 years. I started using blogspot, then switched to tumblr, then svbtle, and now I’m happy and proud to be switching fully to jekyll. I was attracted by the amount of control I have over my content, both in creation and display. Being able to write it using really whatever format I choose is awesome! In case you were wondering, I’m writing this in markdown. I don’t really plan on switching to anything else any time soon, but you never know. I’m excited to be able to easily embed code snippets (with syntax highlighting). That was kind of the breaking point for me with svbtle, &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; code snippets whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be keeping a work log of various projects I’m involved with both now and in the future. This may include ruby (rails), arduino, raspberry pi, verilog/fpga’s, and other various embedded systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep checking back as this should be updated frequently!&lt;/p&gt;
