        The Interview: My Technical Interview That's Almost as Funny as a Seth Rogan Movie

    <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2015</span>

    I’ve been mulling over whether it would be productive to write this experience down or not. I ultimately came to the conclusion that it would not be productive. However, I am currently cramming for finals and cannot make myself study any more. So I figure writing this would be more productive than just refreshing my email over and over for the next two hours. Full disclosure: I don’t really have any valuable tips to give someone in a technical interview. Hopefully at least I can be an example of what not to do. It was Feb. 2013. I had just returned home from a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon). The only reason this is important is because I basically hadn’t touched a computer in two years. At least not in a programming/technical way. Not that I was very technical before that. My uncle...

        How To: Completely Erase the ROM of an EMS 64m USB Gameboy Cart

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2015</span>

    Disclaimer: I am not an expert in Gameboy hardware to any extent, so take this with a grain of salt. Update 1: I neglected to mention there is an app for Android that will allow you to flash the cart using a USB OTG cable. I haven’t used that app, but it may be easier for some people than a command line unix utility. It looks like it only supports reading/writing savs though? Find it here. Update 2: I also neglected to mention that talented hacker MottZilla wrote (patched?) a menu app for Windows that lets you do multi rom and also have multiple savs. I haven’t used that either but it may be worth checking out. You can find his write up here. Recently, I’ve been playing around with my EMS 64m USB gabmeboy cartridge. The cart itself works well for what it is, but the flashing software is...

        Building an Ambient Red Light For the Nursery
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2015</span>

    15 MINUTE PROJECT!!!! Synopsis: Our baby is due in like a month. Crazy. Anticipating the countless hours spent in the nursery in the middle of the night, I wanted some kind of light that would be a little bit easier on the eyes in the middle of the night. I remembered learning that red light travels at a longer wavelength than other colors, so that’s good to use at night because your eyes don’t adjust to it as much. Thanks to Radio Shack going out of business, I picked up a 5 ft roll of red leds for cheap. I figured, why don’t I just go ahead and make a nightlight? It was pretty simple. Details: The led roll runs off of 12v DC. That’s a fairly common voltage, so I had an adapter laying around. I ordered some panel mount barrel connectors to fit the power adapter. I also...

    Recently, my brother and I were working on a programming project. It was a pretty fun one too, so we were immediately sucked in. We started at about 4:30 PM and within probably an hour we had all the framework built out and the only thing left was the “hard part”. Fast forward to about 8 PM. We were stuck dead in our tracks on the “hard part”. Try as we might, there was just no way we could figure out a way to implement it. Then, a thought occurred to me. Working in the past full time professionally doing rails development I would often get distracted, even for stretches of 10 to 15 minutes. Whether it was watching a video on youtube, reading an article online, or just chatting with a coworker about something non work related, it would happen. I would estimate that for each hour I was...

    I’ve been blogging in various forms for at least the last 5 years. I started using blogspot, then switched to tumblr, then svbtle, and now I’m happy and proud to be switching fully to jekyll. I was attracted by the amount of control I have over my content, both in creation and display. Being able to write it using really whatever format I choose is awesome! In case you were wondering, I’m writing this in markdown. I don’t really plan on switching to anything else any time soon, but you never know. I’m excited to be able to easily embed code snippets (with syntax highlighting). That was kind of the breaking point for me with svbtle, no code snippets whatsoever. I will be keeping a work log of various projects I’m involved with both now and in the future. This may include ruby (rails), arduino, raspberry pi, verilog/fpga’s, and other...
