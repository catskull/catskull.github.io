        The Interview: My Technical Interview That's Almost as Funny as a Seth Rogan Movie
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>I’ve been mulling over whether it would be productive to write this experience down or not. I ultimately came to the conclusion that it would <em>not</em> be productive. However, I am currently cramming for finals and cannot make myself study any more. So I figure writing this would be more productive than just refreshing my email over and over for the next two hours. Full disclosure: I don’t really have any valuable tips to give someone in a technical interview. Hopefully at least I can be an example of what not to do.</p>

<p>It was Feb. 2013. I had just returned home from a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon). The only reason this is important is because I basically hadn’t touched a computer in two years. At least not in a programming/technical way. Not that I was very technical before that.</p>

<p>My uncle is a very successful and smart engineer/developer. He has a long list of valid credentials. He phoned me telling me a company he worked for was looking for a Linux server admin and he had remembered that I had played with Linux in the past. Since he was going to be doing the hiring and training, he figured I should apply and he would get me up to speed. Well, that was mistake number one: he overestimated my learning ability. Not only that, but in hindsight I have basically no interest in sysadmin stuff. I don’t now and I probably didn’t then either. But I didn’t really have anything going on, so I figured why not? It would pay well, and give me at least some experience to keep going into the CS field, to some extent.</p>

<p>The first thing we did was get together and prepare my resume. This consisted essentially of us changing the name on his resume and changing the names of the places he’d worked to places I’d worked. I can see now that this was just a formality, since he would really be doing the hiring and training. I didn’t realize that at the time. Then we went through a list of technologies and skills on his resume and cut out the ones I didn’t know. I say didn’t know, but really it was more like things I’d never heard of. Bash? Sure, heard of that. SSH? Yeah I think I had to do that once. A bunch of that kind of thing. Do I really know <em>anything</em> about bash? Absolutely not! At the time I doubt I could have even told you what it was!</p>

<p>Anyways fast forward down the line, I had a job offer. I was supposed to move out to where the job was located (not anywhere close to a place I’d ever lived or been). One day, I told my brother “I really don’t want to move out there and do this job.” He told me: “Then don’t.” So that’s what I did, I bailed. It just didn’t feel right, and rightly so, I can’t even comprehend what it would have been like to get out there and realize how deep I was in over my head, but at the same time feeling like there was no way out. That would have <em>sucked</em>.</p>

<p>The important part here is that I now had a) a job offer and b) a resume that I thought had got me the job offer. The most important part about a job is getting it, right? I have no clue if I had even considered what would happen when I show up day one and have absolutely no idea what’s going on. I never thought that far ahead.</p>

<p>My sort of long term goal was to end up out in Utah, and I would be visiting there soon so I decided to look for Linux server admin jobs in Utah on monster. And what luck! I found one! So I fired them off “my” resume and we set up an interview while I would be out there.</p>

<p>I should mention here something that I comfort myself with at night when I think about this experience and want to crawl out of my skin. I have to find some way to shift some of the guilt of this off of me, and this is what I tell myself. I did not lie about my education on my resume. I put exactly what I had: a high school diploma. Now who in their right mind would ever believe that someone who graduated high school less than 5 years ago, and had been on an LDS mission for two of those, was some kind of Linux guru master? They must have thought I was a prodigy. Sure, they exist . High school kids doing <em>incredible</em> things. I was never one of those kids though. So it was their fault I was even let into the building! Right? Right? Well…that’s what I tell myself.</p>

<p>After getting some feedback on this story, I feel like there is something I should reinforce here. As inexplicable as it may be, I was not aware at this time that I had lied on a resume or that I was even underqualified for this job. Again, someone that I trusted both personally and professionally was okay with what I claimed on my resume. Think about giving your 5 year old the keys to your car. Your child trusts you completely. You’re in the passenger seat, your child is driving. You’re driving down the road, banging into every car along the way. The whole time you’re cheering your kid on “You’re doing great! Great job! You’re an excellent driver!”. At this point, what kind of driver do you think your child thinks they are? They probably believed you when you told them they were an excellent driver, right? If someone else were to ask them what kind of driver they are, your kid would probably just repeat what you had told them, right? That may be a bad example, but that’s the best way I can explain how oblivious I was. I was 22. I should have known better. As hard as it may be to believe, I just didn’t. I don’t know what else I can say. Moving on.</p>

<p>As you can clearly see, I had totally set myself up for failure. Again, I really had no idea what to expect. I hear the term “unknown unknowns” often, to describe something you’re not even aware that you don’t know. I would say that was exactly my experience here. I had <em>no idea</em> what to expect.</p>

<p>The day comes for the interview. I put on my best suit and showed up. “Woah, this is big”, was the first thought when I arrived. I mean, I expected some shop in the corner of an industrial park to be interviewed by maybe some owner/manager that also had no clue about devops. Nope. It was a real, legitimate company, with a huge nice building. The reception area was kind of like an airport terminal, so there was a long desk on the end where multiple receptionists were seated. I walked up to one that wasn’t busy and told him who I was and what I was there for. He said something like “Great, I’ll let them know you’re here.” I happened to spot that he had a Nexus 4 on his desk, and I had just bought one myself and was super stoked about it. That was the first Nexus 4 I had seen in the wild. So I showed him mine and said “Woah, Nexus 4! Nice dude! How do you like it?” He responded with some kind of disinterested “Yeah, it’s great, whatever, you can sit over there while you’re waiting.” Well that guy came across as kind of a dick, but whatever, maybe he was just having a rough day. What he was actually probably thinking was “Who the freak is this kid, interviewing for a job making 80k plus a year?”.</p>

<p>So the guy that’s running the interview shows up and we do the formalities. Then he takes me up to what was basically a server room. I say up, I can’t remember exactly how many stories because we rode in the elevator. I would guess we went up two stories to maybe the third floor? And this whole building was just this company. So again, it’s a huge, real, professional company.</p>

<p>Once we get to the server room, two other guys walk into the room. One is kind of a network guy, and the other is a Linux guy (he was literally wearing a Slackware t-shirt). The guy that took me up there was some kind of project manager from what I could tell. I can’t remember what exactly went on. I think we went over my resume because one question in particular sticks out that makes me want to crawl under a rock and never come out.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know bash?”, the Linux guy asks. “Yeah!” I respond cheerfully. “What have you written in bash then?” This is significant, because it was the first time I had even considered this question. What <em>had</em> I written in bash? I do know what bash is, right? The best response I can come up with was “I don’t remember.” I DON’T REMEMBER!?!?! Are you kidding me? Again, this is something that I comfort myself with. At that point, the interview should have ended. 5 minutes in. I should have been scolded briefly for wasting their time and for falsifying my resume. But nope, they kept on going. Maybe they were enjoying it? The looks on their faces said otherwise.</p>

<p>After going over the fake resume, we transitioned into kind of a question-answer quiz thing. First up was the network guy. I estimate that we spent maybe 5 mintues going back and forth with questions and answers. I have no idea what he was asking me, I didn’t at the time either. TCP something, UDP bla bla bla. HTTP FTP something something. I have no idea what my answers could have been. Maybe I’ve subconsciously blocked them out as a survival tactic. I do remember answering “I don’t know” to some of them, which I have to give myself credit for. I’ve heard of technical interview tactics where they try to get to a point where the candidate doesn’t know the answer to their questions, as a way to test if they’re capable of admitting that they don’t know something. I’m huge on that- the first step in learning something is recognizing you don’t know it right? Never be afraid to admit you don’t know something.</p>

<p>Going on now, we transition to the Linux guy. He does the same question-answer thing, for about the same amount of time. I think I might have done a little better on this one. What that actually means is that I answered a lot less of his questions “I don’t know”. I would bet that I was able to answer about the same amount of questions correctly though, there were just more that I could at least fathom a guess and answer. This guy in particular sticks out to me because his face grew more and more distressed as we went on. By the end he was frowning and pretty much just barking his questions out. It was as if I was killing him. I guess maybe that’s humorous in hind sight. Maybe not.</p>

<p>By the end of these two QA sessions, one thing was explicitly clear to me: I had <em>NO</em> idea what I was doing there. I should have run out of that building right then and there! But I didn’t, because I was and am, an idiot.</p>

<p>Manager guy pipes up, telling me that there was a 3rd phase of the technical interview. I was to configure a CentOS server. He phrased his question something like “Do you think you feel comfortable trying the server part?” but what he was really trying to give me the hint to take his mercy and get the heck out of there. I did not. Again, I comfort myself by questioning why he wouldn’t have just ended the interview there. Why did he even give me a shot? His fault, not mine. Right?</p>

<p>They put me in front of a screen and a keyboard. Note that a mouse was not involved. It was literally just a command line for a CentOS machine. Maybe you’re laughing at this. I had definitely used the command line before, at least enough to know about vim. This part of the interview I have the hardest time remembering. I think at this point I was surviving on pure instinct, like a bug running away from a shoe. I <em>think</em> the Linux guy handed me a sheet of instructions, on a piece of paper. There were maybe 10 steps I was supposed to do? I can’t remember what any of those steps were however.</p>

<p>Oh, and now that I’m thinking about it, I had access to another computer that was a full GUI system and I was allowed to use Google on that.</p>

<p>So I <s>spend</s> waste another 20 minutes of their time googling step by step each one of their instructions. They just sat silently in awe behind me. It was horrible, I can’t imagine the looks they were shooting each other. The only thing I remember about this part was I had to edit a file, so I fired up vim. The only problem was that I had no idea how to use vim. I think I literally googled “how to use vim” and figured out how to at least get into insert mode. I couldn’t figure out how to exit insert mode and save/quit though. I started typing “how to exit vim” into Google but the Linux guy shouted “escape, colon, w, q!”. And yes, I had to google that to even write this post.</p>

<p>I think I might have actually finished the server part? I can’t remember, but I’m pretty sure I didn’t just give up. I swiveled around in my chair and tried my best to smile. I said something like “that’s what I love, just figuring stuff out and learning” as a way to maybe justify how bad I sucked? I mean, what else was I supposed to say?</p>

<p>And then just like that, the interview was over. They did ask me one last question though: “Are you okay to travel?” I can’t believe they didn’t just burst out with laughter at that. Even the suggestion that I was a viable candidate was laughable by then, I’m even chuckling to myself now thinking about it. Just really, the icing on the cake.</p>

<p>I said goodbye to networking and Linux guys and manager guy escorted my back to the lobby. I remember talking to him about how cool I thought Chrome OS was (it was still kinda new at that point). Why I brought up Chrome OS is beyond me. I’m pretty sure I also showed him my Nexus 4. To give him credit, he was nice. Nicer than networking guy and a lot nicer than Linux guy. My theory is that he’s the reason the interview went on. He must have been superior in hierarchy to networking and Linux guys, and he was probably too nice to end the interview.</p>

<p>We got back down to the lobby where it all began, he told me he’d let me know on Monday what they had decided, and it was over.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I did not hear back from them on Monday. Not a decline, not an offer, just nothing. Usually that pisses me off because clearly there’s a reason you didn’t get the job and how can you improve if you don’t know what you did wrong, but this was more like a “go get a degree in IT and come back in four years” thing. It wasn’t in the realm of “you kept picking your nose in the interview” or “another candidate has foreign language experience.” No amount of feedback could have helped me.</p>

<p>I’ve thought about that interview a lot over the past 2-3 years, however long it’s been. I’ve gotten jobs with a real resume. I’ve worked at a car wash, in retail sales, web development. I got all those jobs with a real resume. I don’t have a ton of regrets about the interview itself. It may sound crazy, but given my level of skill and capability, I think I actually interviewed pretty well. Obviously I regret faking a resume, but in my defense I didn’t really know I was faking it. Again, that sounds insane, but if someone who does know something tells you you know it too, you believe them. At least I did. And I can’t throw my Uncle under the bus too much, he didn’t intend for me to actually use this resume in real life.</p>

<p>And that’s really all there is to say. Don’t fake your resume, kids. I remember when I was a kid my friends brother told me he could jump over my house. I believed him at first, but when I asked to see a demonstration it was clear that he could not. You have nothing to gain by lying. It’s okay if you don’t know everything. I can promise you this: if you lie on your resume and get the job, you’ll be miserable. And if you’re not, lying on a resume isn’t the extent of your problems.</p>

        How To: Completely Erase the ROM of an EMS 64m USB Gameboy Cart
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2015</span>

    <h3 id="disclaimer-i-am-not-an-expert-in-gameboy-hardware-to-any-extent-so-take-this-with-a-grain-of-salt">Disclaimer: I am not an expert in Gameboy hardware to any extent, so take this with a grain of salt.</h3>

<p>Update 1: I neglected to mention there is an app for Android that will allow you to flash the cart using a USB OTG cable. I haven’t used that app, but it may be easier for some people than a command line unix utility. It looks like it only supports reading/writing savs though? Find it <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shiftfypixlz.aread.emsflasher">here</a>.</p>

<p>Update 2: I also neglected to mention that talented hacker MottZilla wrote (patched?) a menu app for Windows that lets you do multi rom and also have multiple savs. I haven’t used that either but it may be worth checking out. You can find his write up <a href="http://thegaminguniverse.org/ninjagaiden4/mottzilla/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been playing around with my EMS 64m USB gabmeboy cartridge. The cart itself works well for what it is, but the flashing software is completely lacking. It’s Windows only, and that’s if you’re even able to get the drivers installed (which is basically impossible). The cart has two “pages” each 32mbit for a total of 64. It changes between the two pages with a ghetto power cycle. Basically it just has a little capacitor that gets charged when the gameboy is on, and if the cap still has a charge when the cartridge is booted it goes to page 2. This works pretty well for getting from page 1 to page 2, but getting from page 2 back to 1 is a hassle because you just have to wait for the capacitor to discharge. That makes me wonder how hard it would be to replace the capacitor with a switch or button of some kind, but that’s beyond the scope of this post.</p>

<p>Another interesting drawback to the cart is that it can only support one sav at a time. In other words, if you had Pokemon Blue on page 1, and Pokemon Gold on page 2, you could only keep one save for each at a time. Save in Blue, then switch to Gold and save and guess what? Your blue save is gone.</p>

<p>The windows flashing utility that ships with the cart has support for multi rom. I don’t know the intricacies of it, but basically it just patches all the roms you give it into one big rom, and then throws on a custom menu rom they made. <s>So the short story is that the cart itself is "dumb", and their patched multirom menu could be used just as well on almost any flash cart.</s> <em>This is incorrect.</em> Thanks to nitro2k01 for pointing out the mistakes. There are special properties of the EMS cart that will only allow their menu rom to work on and EMS cart. For a more in depth explanation, visit his writup <a href="http://blog.gg8.se/wordpress/2013/03/04/gameboy-project-week-9-the-ems-cartridges-something-old-and-something-new-something-black-and-something-blue-and-how-sloppy-cartridge-design-affects-you/">here</a>. Because of the wackyness of switching pages, usually I just like to put the exact same roms on both pages, so I don’t have to deal with it. I mean, how many roms could you possibly want on the same cart, especialy given the limited sav space? So I have LSDJ as my “main” rom (intended for use saves), and then a bunch of non-save roms (like tetris).</p>

<p>Fortunately, Mike Ryan wrote a command-line driver for *nix systems. You can find more information about that <a href="http://lacklustre.net/projects/ems-flasher/">here</a>. It works extremely well and is ultra reliable. The one caveat is that it does not support multi rom. It can write to both pages, but only one rom on each.</p>

<p>Talented “Gameboy Genius” nitro2k01 has been working on a file manager called LittleFM for LSDJ for some time. The goal is to add better song management to LSDJ, as well as other cool features like the ability to transfer songs over a link cable. He achieved this by writing a rom that is then patched onto the LSDJ rom. So rather then booting straight to LSDJ, you’re greeted by his file manager that can then load a song and boot into LSDJ. As an experiment he wrote a multi rom menu specifically for the EMS cart. It’s a dirty hack; you have to manually append the roms you want to the patched LSDJ rom with a tool like cat on Unix or copy on Windows. The end result is one large gameboy rom with LSDJ, the file manager, and your other roms all nicely tucked into one big rom. More information about that can be found <a href="http://blog.gg8.se/wordpress/2013/02/04/gameboy-project-week-5-littlefm-05-finally-released/">here</a>. Now we have a nice multi rom image ready to flash with Mike Ryan’s custom *nix driver!</p>

<p>It works great!</p>

<p><strong><em>This is where the blog post gets on topic.</em></strong></p>

<p>The one issue is that it appears that the *nix driver only overwrites the sectors of the of the memory that it needs to. Say you’re flashing an 8 megabit rom, it will only overwrite the first 8 megabits of the memory. This is normal operation for memory writing. Deleting a file on your computer doesn’t actually delete it, it just tells the system that space can now be safely overwritten. The issue comes from how nitro2k01’s multi rom menu works. From my understanding it just looks for any other rom headers in the memory. But what happens if you flash a multi rom image that takes up all the memory, but then later decide that you don’t want all those roms and flash a smaller rom, the other roms will still show up in the menu because they haven’t actually been overwritten! If I’m not explaining this very well, just let met know. I will include pictures below as well for clarification.</p>

<p>I worked up a solution to this that’s extremely simple. If you’re reformatting a drive on your computer and want to make sure none of the files can be recovered, you have to not only reformat the drive, but overwrite all data with 0’s or something like that. Knowning that, I fired up my hex editor and wrote a file that’s 32 mbit in size and contains only 0’s. Then I wrote that to my cart. I booted it up to make sure everything was gone, and then re-wrote my multi rom. And just like that, all the old roms were gone, and only the new ones were there!
After the fact, <a href="http://jazz-disassemblies.blogspot.com/">Jordan Appleton-Joslin</a> recommended writing all 1’s instead of 0’s. Something to do with a detail that it’s quicker for the rom to overwrite a 1 than it is to overwrite a 0. A little bit beyond my understanding. The download now links to a rom that contains only 1’s. Thanks Jordan!</p>

<p>To expand on this, it would be nice to contribute more to the *nix driver to include either support for writing to specific locations or for multi rom support out of the box. Unfortunately my C driver coding skills are nonexistent so that’s not happening any time soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://goo.gl/uxE5nU">The blank rom can be downloaded here.</a></p>

<p><img src="/public/ems/badrom.jpg" alt="Bad rom! I don't want all of those!" />
I only want the top two roms to show up in the menu.</p>

<p><img src="/public/ems/blank.jpg" alt="Blank" />
Just what I want, a totally blank rom!</p>

<p><img src="/public/ems/goodrom.jpg" alt="Good rom!" />
The payoff, after re flashing the multi rom image, only to two that I want are there!</p>

        Building an Ambient Red Light For the Nursery
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>15 MINUTE PROJECT!!!!</p>

<p>Synopsis: Our baby is due in like a month. Crazy. Anticipating the countless hours spent in the nursery in the middle of the night, I wanted some kind of light that would be a little bit easier on the eyes in the middle of the night. I remembered learning that red light travels at a longer wavelength than other colors, so that’s good to use at night because your eyes don’t adjust to it as much. Thanks to Radio Shack going out of business, I picked up a 5 ft roll of red leds for cheap. I figured, why don’t I just go ahead and make a nightlight? It was pretty simple.</p>

<p>Details: The led roll runs off of 12v DC. That’s a fairly common voltage, so I had an adapter laying around. I ordered some panel mount barrel connectors to fit the power adapter. I also ordered some handly little switches that have a power indicator led built into them. They are designed to be used in a car, so the led needs 12v also. You could use the switch for any voltage, but it must be 12v for the led to turn on. The last thing was just a cheap project box. All of these were bought off eBay for a total of around $10. Soldering it up was pretty straightforward, as was drilling the appropriate holes in the enclosure. I mounted the enclosure to the side of our changing table so I could run the led strip behind it to diffuse the bright leds a little bit. Have you ever had an led shining straight into your eye? Not fun, no matter what color it is. The only thing left was a little bit of hot glue to secure the led strip in place, and I was in business. Overall, I’m pretty happy with the result.</p>

<p>Difficulty: One poopy diaper.</p>

<p>Frustration: One stinky diaper.</p>

<p>Payoff: A sleeping little babe (and wife!)</p>

<p>Overall project: A lot easier than having a baby, that’s for sure.</p>

    <p>Recently, my brother and I were working on a programming project. It was a pretty fun one too, so we were immediately sucked in. We started at about 4:30 PM and within probably an hour we had all the framework built out and the only thing left was the “hard part”. Fast forward to about 8 PM. We were stuck dead in our tracks on the “hard part”. Try as we might, there was just no way we could figure out a way to implement it.</p>

<p>Then, a thought occurred to me.</p>

<p>Working in the past full time professionally doing rails development I would often get distracted, even for stretches of 10 to 15 minutes. Whether it was watching a video on youtube, reading an article online, or just chatting with a coworker about something non work related, it would happen. I would estimate that for each hour I was at work, this would occur at least once. Often I would feel extremely guilty for being at work, getting paid, and not really working. I’m sure any manager out there reading this is currently looking up my previous employers to convince them to sue me. Just bear with me while I attempt to get my point across.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span">wikipedia article</a> on attention span suggests that the average healthy adult can focus on one thing for anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes. The argument could certainly be made that programming doesn’t involve just focusing on one thing, but rather many different thinks and multitasking. However, I tend to view any given project to be one whole thing one would focus their attention on (i.e., wether you’re digging the post holes or painting it, at the end of the day you’ve still <em>only</em> been building a fence all day). The wikipedia article doesn’t go into details about what usually happens when an adult tries to focus on something <em>longer</em> than their attention span, but I have some thoughts to share from my experience.</p>

<p>Consider that if I am focusing on my work for 100% of the time I am at work, I would also be 100% productive. However, the facts show that this is virtually impossible for any normal human adult. So let’s say, and this is an extreme estimation, that I am only focusing on my work for half the time I’m at work. In other words, hypothetically, I’m only 50% productive. So I get only 4 hours of work done in a given 8 hour period. Ideally, I’d be able to be 100% productive. But in reality, I’d get to work, be 100% effective for <em>maybe</em> the first 3 hours, and by 11 AM I’d be completely burnt out and probably wouldn’t be able to work much more for the rest of the day. So I would get 3 hours of work done in an 8 hour period. Granted that my examples or exaggerated and extreme, but I think the point is still solid. <em>I’m better off working slowly.</em></p>

<p>Now let’s jump back to my brother and I scratching our heads with impossibility.</p>

<p>We had been focusing 100% of our attention on our project for about 3 and 1/2 hours. Or 1000% of our maximum attention span of 20 minutes. In order to proceed on the project, we shut the computer off, went to dinner, and didn’t think or talk about the project until the next day. In other words, <em>we were sick of our project</em>. At that 8 PM mark if you would have given me the option to take a bullet to the foot and never have to think about the project again, or being forced to work on it for another 30 minutes, I would have seriously considered taking the bullet. Can you imagine if I’d been at work, getting paid, and had a manager bearing down on me to get the project finished <em>that day</em>?</p>

<p>But <em>why</em>? Why were we to burned out? Remember, this was initially something we had found “fun”! Why would I prefer to get shot rather than working on something I considered entertaining? A possible theory was that the project just didn’t have enough “fun” in it to last that long. I would argue against that because upon resuming the project the next day, I again found it to be “fun”. I think really the only reason is that I just didn’t have the mental capacity to focus on a task for that long. <em>I needed to take a break.</em></p>

<p>We’ve all read time and again articles that say you should spend x amount of time doing something else for every y amount of time you’re working on the computer. “Stand for every 10 minutes of sitting down.” I tend to be a believer in those recommendations, for the most part. Of course, the implementation proves to be exponentially more difficult than the discovery. And I think really, at the end of the day, it’s all the same thing: <strong>SLOW DOWN</strong>. Take a break. Relax. Go show a coworker a youtube video. Read an article unrelated to work. For heaven’s sake, go take a short walk outside. Because if you’re anything like I am, it will be for your own good. You will become more productive, reduce stress, drastically limit burnout, and be generally a happier and more effective person in general.</p>

    <p>I’ve been blogging in various forms for at least the last 5 years. I started using blogspot, then switched to tumblr, then svbtle, and now I’m happy and proud to be switching fully to jekyll. I was attracted by the amount of control I have over my content, both in creation and display. Being able to write it using really whatever format I choose is awesome! In case you were wondering, I’m writing this in markdown. I don’t really plan on switching to anything else any time soon, but you never know. I’m excited to be able to easily embed code snippets (with syntax highlighting). That was kind of the breaking point for me with svbtle, <em>no</em> code snippets whatsoever.</p>

<p>I will be keeping a work log of various projects I’m involved with both now and in the future. This may include ruby (rails), arduino, raspberry pi, verilog/fpga’s, and other various embedded systems.</p>

<p>Keep checking back as this should be updated frequently!</p>
