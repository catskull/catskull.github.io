My Nexus 5 had an update this morning. From Android 5.1 to 5.1.1. I couldn't tell you what it changed. I hope it fixed the memory leak that's been plauging me for a while now. I doubt it did. Honestly I don't really care any more. It's been a great phone. I bought it almost two years ago and it's done everything I wanted it to and more. My needs haven't really changed since I've owned it, but the market for cost effective off-contract phones has. Dramatically.

In June of 2014, almost a year to the date of this writing, Google announced their new "Android One" initiative. The long story is that manufacturers can build low cost devices for emerging markets and turn over the software to Google (kind of makes me wish Google would do the same for all devices, but that's another story). The short story is that Google is currently completely dominating that market with their Android system, and with that comes the influx of new customers for their services and more faces to throw ads at. It's a win-win. Look at the fact that the Moto G, a $149 off-contract phone is Motorola's best selling phone of all time.http://www.androidcentral.com/moto-g-motorolas-most-successful-smartphone-ever At first that may not seem to impressive, but remember another phone Moto made at one point: the Razr. How many people did you know that owned Razr'ss? I knew dozens. How many people do you know that own Moto G's? I know maybe one person. So where are all those device sales coming from? Emerging markets.

Thanks to that massive success, I can't help but imagine that other manufacturers are realizing that the need for low-cost high-quality off-contract Android devices isn't exclusive to third world markets. We've seen the somewhat viral success of phones like the Oneplus One, which ships with a near stock version of Android (there's quite a bit more to that story, but I won't speak of it here). Motorola claims to be making a profit on each Moto G sold, so why wouldn't other manufacturers try it out? We've seen devices come out from Acer, Oppo, Huwawei and others but all of them seemed to be inheritnely flawed in one way or another. But suddenly, another device showed up from a company I had never heard of.

The inexplicably named Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3. I think the company is named Alcatel Onetouch, and the phone is named Idol 3. Who cares. It retails for $249 off-contract. The 5.5 inch phone had several key features that grew my excitement: dual high quality JBL front facing speakers, a micro sd card slot, and a larger battery than my Nexus 5. That was enough to get me interested. "I'm sure they destroyed it with an awful Android skin, or it runs like Froyo or something" I told myself as I clicked links to find more. I was somewhat shocked and pleasently surprised to find out neither of those things were true. It runs a near stock Android build and currently has 5.0 lollipop. Pretty impressive as many flagship $600+ phones don't currently have either of those things.

My excitement grew as I learned about some great insights Alcatel put into this experience. Since there are speakers and mics on both the top and bottom of the screen, you can hold the phone either way to talk on it and use it. Really not that great I guess, but when you get a call at 6 am because some senior citizen namen Kathy is giving out your number as her own and the senior shuttle wants to let her know that they're there to pick her up for the day activity (yes, this happened/is happening), it can be nice. Even sublter, the speakers are slightly recessed behind the screen so if it's face down they won't be completely muffled. How great! I mean, the actual use of something like is arguable, but small consideration like that are very welcome in an age when the customer seems like an afterthought and all manufactureres are concerned about is how much they can cram onto their spec sheet.

Top all of that with a micro SDXC card slot. Definately not a feature I put high on my priority list, but it's nice to have. I also loved the overall design. It looks basically like an oversized Nexus 4, another phone I owned and loved. The back is plastic but it's brushed in a way that looks like metal. The camera sits completely flush on the back which apparently is uncommon in a day when Apple is photoshopping camera bulge out of their product pictures. The sides have two metal rings the sandwich a plastic middle. It feels fine. Honestly I'm not a huge fan of the ultra <s>slick</s> slippery all aluminum bodies that seem to be so in style right now. All in all it was right up my alley.

I kept waiting for the flaw that would just kill the whole deal. With hardware perfect, surely they would have completely botched the software with a horrible skin and bloatware. I was shocked to find that was not the case. They do have some customizations but they are very minimal and unubtrusive. Really the extent of it is that they changed some of the stock apps (dialer, clock, contacts, etc) icons. I would prefer it if they had left that tweak out, but they're not bad icons by any means. There's also a "sweep all" icon on the multi tasking menu. I like the concept, but it does this really weird animation where it will swipe the app to the far side, hang for a moment, then get rid of it. It really looks like it's lagging but it's not. But really, this was far more stock Android than not.

With all of that, I was sold. I'll admit that I tentatavely held out for Google I/O in hopes they would announce an updated Nexus 5 which of course they didn't because screw you that's why. After that I pulled the trigger, and I pulled it hard. I even upgraded for one day shipping.

Inside the box was the phone, a wall charger, a USB cable, a sim card ejector, and incredibly a pair of high quality JBL earbuds. I'd say the headphones are worth and easy $20 at least. They're really great! All the other accessories were equally high quality. They definately did not skimp on packaging or accessories, something surprising in a phone this low budget.

I should go back to the speakers. They are absolutely incredible. They reach levels almost ludicrously loud. Setting an alarm I had to set it on the lowest possible setting other than mute in order to not completely fall out of my bed in the morning. Music, movies, and games all sound incredible on this. Combine that with a 5.5 inch laminated 1080p display and this phone is a true media experience. Something I had never seen or expereinced on really any portable device, especially a phone. Showing my wife a funny video I came across was an absolute treat, even in a busy restaurant. The speakers can more than handle it.
