    Over the summer, I’ve been interning at Digi International doing python testing on their various radios such as the Xbee. It’s been pretty cool I guess, other than the fact I am forced to use Windows, my keyboard’s space bar emits a high pitched squeak whenever I hit it, and the git client they use is simply awful (it’s Atlassian’s SourceTree, but at least they use git!). It’s been really cool to work alongside some real-life, bonafide engineers who know what the heck they’re doing. Also my manager is so good at managing he could be admitted to the Justice League on those skills alone. One of the things I was invited to participate in was an “intern challenge.” The idea is to do a fun project to show off what you’ve learned over the summer. I had way more project ideas than I’ll ever have time for, so I...

        Ditching the Arduino IDE

    Recently, my good friend and crazy talented hacker Ultifinitus gave me some sweet hardware. Out of the goodness of his heart. What a nice guy! It consisted of an Arduino Mega and some other stuff that I’ll go more into in a later post. I haven’t done a ton of arduino stuff in the past, but I’ve done enough to know that the default Arduino IDE sucks. Those may be strong words I guess, it’s open source and cross platform and it works, but it just has a pretty poor text editor. I decided if I was going to do anything worthwhile with the hardware, I needed an environment I could be productive in. Specifically, I like using Github’s excellent editor, Atom. It’s open source, cross platform, and is a pretty great text editor! This post will serve as a reference for what I was able to get set up....

    My Nexus 5 had an update this morning. From Android 5.1 to 5.1.1. I couldn’t tell you what it changed. I hope it fixed the memory leak that’s been plauging me for a while now. I doubt it did. Honestly I don’t really care any more. It’s been a great phone. I bought it almost two years ago and it’s done everything I wanted it to and more. My needs haven’t really changed since I’ve owned it, but the market for cost effective off-contract phones has. Dramatically. In June of 2014, almost a year to the date of this writing, Google announced their new “Android One” initiative. The long story is that manufacturers can build low cost devices for emerging markets and turn over the software to Google (kind of makes me wish Google would do the same for all devices, but that’s another story). The short story is that...

        Lagrange Point Famicom English Hack
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2015</span>

    A few posts back I documented converting a Famicom game (Princess Tomato and the Salad Kingdom) to use the English translation. Since that went so well, I finally had the courage to try the game I really wanted to do: Lagrange Point. I think it’s fair for me to do a little background on this incredible game. Lagrange Point was developed by Konami and released in Japan for the Nintendo Famicom on April 26, 1991 (two days before I was born!). It’s a totally rad space opera rpg with some unique game mechanics that make it quite fun. It also had some audio features that I’ll go into more detail about. The Famicom supported “expansion audio”. That is, game cartridges were able to have their own sound chips to expand what the Famicom was normally capable of making. Several games took advantage of this, such as Castlevania 3. In fact...

    Mid-Week Summer Project! Synopsys: In 1985 Nintendo released the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America to huge commercial success. This was particularly impressive due to the fact that the home video game market was in a slump caused by a market flood of cheaply made games and systems. Part of the reason the NES was such a success was that Nintendo marketed the console as a complete “home entertainment system” that was so much more than just a video game console. It wasn’t really, but the marketing paid off. That’s why it looks more like a VCR than a video game system, and the first release was even bundled with a robot! Two years earlier, Nintendo had dome something very similar in Japan by releasing the Family Computer, or as it’s more commonly known the Famicom. The two systems were essentially identical internally but had vastly different designs aesthetically. One...
