        Ditching the Arduino IDE
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>Recently, my good friend and crazy talented hacker Ultifinitus gave me some sweet hardware. Out of the goodness of his heart. What a nice guy! It consisted of an Arduino Mega and some other stuff that I’ll go more into in a later post. I haven’t done a ton of arduino stuff in the past, but I’ve done enough to know that the default Arduino IDE sucks. Those may be strong words I guess, it’s open source and cross platform and it works, but it just has a pretty poor text editor. I decided if I was going to do anything worthwhile with the hardware, I needed an environment I could be productive in. Specifically, I like using Github’s excellent editor, Atom. It’s open source, cross platform, and is a pretty great text editor! This post will serve as a reference for what I was able to get set up.</p>

<p>Atom needs almost no customization out of the box. The only package to install is <a href="https://atom.io/packages/language-arduino">language-arduino</a> which “adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Arduino files in Atom”.</p>

<p>The real meat and potatoes is <a href="http://inotool.org/">Ino</a>. This is a command line interface for building and uploading arduino code. It works pretty well. Install it with pip by executing <code>pip install ino</code>. (As a side note, I use python every day at work and a <em>still</em> fell a little gross every time I use pip. It’s like the inbred step brother of RubyGems and it makes me wish everything was written in Ruby.)</p>

<p>Perhaps the reason I feel gross for using pip is that usually the packages I’m installing are a little gross. Don’t get me wrong, I commend the men and women who spend hours upon end doing the thankless task of contributing to open source projects, only to be berated with senseless issues and internet trolls. I guess if I have issues with some open source software I’m using I should just contribute and try to fix it, but one project at a time right? Ino has more good than bad all things considered.</p>

<p>So once you’ve gotten ino installed, there’s very little you need to do in the way of setting it up. Navigate to the directory you want to keep your project. For me its <code>ddegraw/code/new_project</code> and execute an <code>ino init</code> command. This will create a src and a lib directory. src is where you’ll keep your code, and lib is useless. lib is <em>supposed</em> to be where you put libraries you want to use, but I (<a href="https://github.com/amperka/ino/issues/164">and some other people</a> couldn’t get that to work so I just stuck everything in the src directory. One important thing to note is that ino <em>will not</em> automatically scan your arduino libraries, so if you want to include anything you have to copy it over to the src directory.</p>

<p>Inside the src folder there should be a sketch.ino created. This is where you can write the bulk of your code, consider it you “main”.</p>

<p>Once you have all of that set up, you’re pretty much good to go. There are a few caveats that I’d like to mention however.</p>

<p>First, you should create a ino.ini file in the root of your project. Inside, you can specify which serial port to use and which board you’re targeting. For example, I’m using a mega 2560 so mine looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>[build]
board-model = mega2560

[upload]
board-model = mega2560
serial-port = /dev/tty.usbmodem1421

[serial]
serial-port = /dev/tty.usbmodem1421
</code></pre>

<p>Each one of the [] blocks defines settings for a command. I would like it if that wasn’t the case, and instead you just chose <em>one</em> board and <em>one</em> serial port. How likely is it that you’re wanting to build for a mega2560 but upload for an Uno <em>within the same project</em>? Fail. Whatever.</p>

<p>I think you can also put those settings in ~/.inorc, but I haven’t tried that and don’t really care to. The only advantage of that would be that those settings would be used as your global defaults.</p>

<p>To build, simply execute <code>ino build</code> from the root of your project. To upload, simply execute <code>ino upload</code> from the same place. Pretty simple. I made an alias to do both of those at the same time because more often than not that’s what I want to do.</p>

<p>That’s really it as far as the environment is concerned. It works fairly well and is easily as featured as the Arduino IDE is.</p>

<p>I would like to take a moment at the end to talk about a fork of Ino called Arturo. The creators of Ino no longer have time or motivation to maintain it. A quick look at the issues section of the GitHub repo will be a prime example of what open source hell looks like. <a href="https://github.com/scottdarch">Scott Dixon</a> offered to take over management of the repo, but the creators preferred him to fork it. In my opinion that is a poor decision on their end, but at the same time I can understand why they would chose that. It doesn’t look like he’s made too many changes yet, but he is a very good maintainer. Issues are clear, valid, and labeled. While he doesn’t have time to work on every little feature, he does keep the issues well under control. Unfortunately, I was not able to get it to work with my device, but I’ve opened an issue and would love to help contribute to make it better. I have opened a pull request for a seperate tiny issue and it will be exciting to see how he handles contributions!</p>

<p>And lastly, it looks like there is <a href="http://hackaday.com/2014/04/20/sublime-text-as-an-arduino-ide/">something similar</a> that relies on Sublime Text. I have no desire to use or pay for Sublime Text though, but it may be worth checking out.</p>

        Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3 Review
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>My Nexus 5 had an update this morning. From Android 5.1 to 5.1.1. I couldn’t tell you what it changed. I hope it fixed the memory leak that’s been plauging me for a while now. I doubt it did. Honestly I don’t really care any more. It’s been a great phone. I bought it almost two years ago and it’s done everything I wanted it to and more. My needs haven’t really changed since I’ve owned it, but the market for cost effective off-contract phones has. Dramatically.</p>

<p>In June of 2014, almost a year to the date of this writing, Google announced their new “Android One” initiative. The long story is that manufacturers can build low cost devices for emerging markets and turn over the software to Google (kind of makes me wish Google would do the same for all devices, but that’s another story). The short story is that Google is currently completely dominating that market with their Android system, and with that comes the influx of new customers for their services and more faces to throw ads at. It’s a win-win. Look at the fact that the Moto G, a $149 off-contract phone is <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/moto-g-motorolas-most-successful-smartphone-ever">Motorola’s best selling phone of all time.</a> At first that may not seem to impressive, but remember another phone Moto made at one point: the Razr. How many people did you know that owned Razrs? I knew dozens. How many people do you know that own Moto G’s? I know maybe one person. So where are all those device sales coming from? Emerging markets.</p>

<p>Thanks to that massive success, I can’t help but imagine that other manufacturers are realizing that the need for low-cost high-quality off-contract Android devices isn’t exclusive to third world markets. We’ve seen the somewhat viral success of phones like the Oneplus One, which ships with a near stock version of Android (there’s quite a bit more to that story, but I won’t speak of it here). Motorola claims to be making a profit on each Moto G sold, so why wouldn’t other manufacturers try it out? We’ve seen devices come out from Acer, Oppo, Huwawei and others but all of them seemed to be inheritnely flawed in one way or another. But suddenly, another device showed up from a company I had never heard of.</p>

<p><img src="http://catskull.net/public/idol3/inhand.jpg" alt="Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3" /></p>

<p>The inexplicably named Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3. I think the company is named Alcatel Onetouch, and the phone is named Idol 3. Who cares. It retails for $249 off-contract. The 5.5 inch phone had several key features that grew my excitement: dual high quality JBL front facing speakers, a micro sd card slot, and a larger battery than my Nexus 5. That was enough to get me interested. “I’m sure they destroyed it with an awful Android skin, or it runs like Froyo or something” I told myself as I clicked links to find more. I was somewhat shocked and pleasently surprised to find out neither of those things were true. It runs a near stock Android build and currently has 5.0 lollipop. Pretty impressive as many flagship $600+ phones don’t currently have either of those things.</p>

<p>My excitement grew as I learned about some great insights Alcatel put into this experience. Since there are speakers and mics on both the top and bottom of the screen, you can hold the phone either way to talk on it and use it. Really not that great I guess, but when you get a call at 6 am because some senior citizen namen Kathy is giving out your number as her own and the senior shuttle wants to let her know that they’re there to pick her up for the day activity (yes, this happened/is happening), it can be nice. Even sublter, the speakers are slightly recessed behind the screen so if it’s face down they won’t be completely muffled. How great! I mean, the actual use of something like is arguable, but small consideration like that are very welcome in an age when the customer seems like an afterthought and all manufactureres are concerned about is how much they can cram onto their spec sheet.</p>

<p>Top all of that with a micro SDXC card slot. Definately not a feature I put high on my priority list, but it’s nice to have. I also loved the overall design. It looks basically like an oversized Nexus 4, another phone I owned and loved. The back is plastic but it’s brushed in a way that looks like metal. The camera sits completely flush on the back which apparently is uncommon in a day when Apple is photoshopping camera bulge out of their product pictures. The sides have two metal rings the sandwich a plastic middle. It feels fine. Honestly I’m not a huge fan of the ultra <s>slick</s> slippery all aluminum bodies that seem to be so in style right now. All in all it was right up my alley.</p>

<p>I kept waiting for the flaw that would just kill the whole deal. With hardware perfect, surely they would have completely botched the software with a horrible skin and bloatware. I was shocked to find that was not the case. They do have some customizations but they are very minimal and unubtrusive. Really the extent of it is that they changed some of the stock apps (dialer, clock, contacts, etc) icons. I would prefer it if they had left that tweak out, but they’re not bad icons by any means. There’s also a “sweep all” icon on the multi tasking menu. I like the concept, but it does this really weird animation where it will swipe the app to the far side, hang for a moment, then get rid of it. It really looks like it’s lagging but it’s not. But really, this was far more stock Android than not.</p>

<p>With all of that, I was sold. I’ll admit that I tentatavely held out for Google I/O in hopes they would announce an updated Nexus 5 which of course they didn’t because screw you that’s why. After that I pulled the trigger, and I pulled it hard. I even upgraded for one day shipping.</p>

<p>Inside the box was the phone, a wall charger, a USB cable, a sim card ejector, and incredibly a pair of high quality JBL earbuds. I’d say the headphones are worth and easy $20 at least. They’re really great! All the other accessories were equally high quality. They definately did not skimp on packaging or accessories, something surprising in a phone this low budget.</p>

<p>When I first took the phone out of the box, I was a little bit shocked at how large it is. Sure they say 5.5 inches but who the heck knows what that actually feels like? Though now that I say that, the iPhone 6+ is also 5.5 inches. My friend Colton got one of those and when I saw it I was in disbelief. It just seemed unusabely huge. This phone definately feels big, but not as big as the 6+. It has a nice 1080p display that really looks quite good. In fact, it is the best display I have ever seen when in direct sunlight. In the past I’ve just gotten used to not being able to see anything on my phone if I was outside in the sun, but this phone isn’t like that. It’s almost hard to explain. I have no idea what they did to the display to make that happen, but other phones have a lot to take from here.</p>

<p>I should go back to the speakers. They are absolutely incredible. They reach levels almost ludicrously loud. Setting an alarm I had to set it on the lowest possible setting other than mute in order to not completely fall out of my bed in the morning. Music, movies, and games all sound incredible on this. Combine that with a 5.5 inch laminated 1080p display and this phone is a true media experience. Something I had never seen or expereinced on really any portable device, especially a phone. Showing my wife a funny video I came across was an absolute treat, even in a busy restaurant. The speakers can more than handle it. I find myself actually using the phone as more of a portable speaker. Playing music while in the shower is totally fine. I probably wouldn’t DJ my housewarming party with it, but it’s great for pretty much anything other than that. While navigating, I enjoy getting crystal clear directions, even if the phone is in my pocket.</p>

<p>Speaking of having the phone in my pocket, it doesn’t like to stay there! I think it’s a combination of how big the phone is, as well as how thin and light it is, but it just slides right out of my pocket. I’ve had to fish it out from under the car’s seat several times. Even at work sometimes sitting in my chair, I’ll just hear a plop and the phones on the ground. That issue has been negated somewhat by using a cheap (though nice) gel/rubbery case.</p>

<p>The real reason for buying a case wasn’t so much to help with the sliding, but another issue. The screen’s bezels are so thin on the sides that when holding it with one hand I frequently would accidentally touch the sides of the screen and click things and wreak all sorts of havok. Who would have thought, the phones bezels being too thin would be an issue? That was really why I got the case, just to give me a little something more to hold onto. And it’s a nice case as well, super thin and looks great. With the added protection, it’s more than worth it.</p>

<p>Another slight annoyance is the button layout. The power button is on the upper left side, with the volume buttons on the upper right side. Basically opposite from any other phone. I have no clue why Alcatel would go for something like that, but it’s a really minor issue. You could say that there’s just as much reason to have the power on the left as there is to have it on the right. And it was maybe a day getting used to so no complaints there. One tiny quirk is that the micro USB charging slot is not centered on the bottom of the phone, but more off to the right of the bottom of the phone. Again, not really an issue, but it’s just interesting.</p>

<p>The Idol 3 has an incredible battery in my opinion. 3000mah, roughly on par with the 6+’s battery. This thing can go all day with NFC, WiFi, cellular, as well as moderate use with at least 50% left at the end of the day. That I love. It seemed like my Nexus 5 just ripped through it’s battery, whether I used it or not. It will be interesting to see if battery life diminishes at all as I use it more.</p>

<p>The software was a little bit worst and a little bit better than I expected it. Most of the apps are the stock Android Open Source apps. Things like the dialer, clock, etc. The issue is that those open source apps aren’t really considered to be “stock” Android apps because Google has gone off and made their own proprietary versions. So they are not the same apps that show up on a Nexus device. Well, I guess that’s not entirely true. It’s very close. It came pre loaded with some “bloatware” apps. I actually don’t even remember what they were because uninstalling them was the first thing I did. Keyword there: uninstall. Because you can. You’re not locked into anything. Alcatel also included a few of their own utility apps like a file manager, a notes app, and a sound recorder. They are high quality and actually usefule. They keep very much the theme of material design and I think you’d be surprised to find out Google didn’t make them. They’re all things I had on my phone anyways, so it’s just nice to have them there. The phone does have a slightly tweaked launcher, but I uninstalled that in favor of the Google Now Launcher. The only drawback is that the phone features a double tap to wake/lock feature. Waking works fine (well, sort of), but double tap to lock only works in their stock launcher. Oh well I guess. It also has an FM radio built in, which is cool and maybe potentially useful?</p>

<p>I think the camera app is custom made my Alcatel. I tried the Google camera, and it was laggy and didn’t work nearly as well as the stock camera, so I switched to that. I rarely take pictures on my phone, so it is a bit of a moot point for me. I can say that the camera doesn’t dissappoint me. I have a DSLR camera for when I want to take DSLR quality photos. Snapping pics of my son works just fine with this camera. I guess I’m neither impressed or uninmpressed. I just don’t really care about a phone’s camera. If it didin’t have one, I might not even notice.</p>

<p>The double tap to wake just doesn’t really work that well. Half the time it straight up doesn’t work, and when it does it takes so long to respond that I’ve already pressed the actual button and they end up cancelling each other out. Alcatel has promised to tweak it in future updates, but we’ll see what happens. Honestly I’m not really crossing my fingers, though software updates are what will make or break this phone.</p>

<p>Community support (aka custom roms) is still very limited (nonexistant) at this point. It’s just too early to tell. Alcatel has promised to release the source code for the bootloader and rom in order to comply with the GPL. I honestly have faith that they will. It will be nice to see where we’re at a year from now.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it’s not a “flagship killer” by any means. It isn’t supposed to be either though. This phone is intended to redefine what an off-contract phone can be, and it certainly does that. Alcatel put more thought into what customers might actually want than Samsung could do if their lives depended on it. I think that’s the best way to describe this phone: it’s just great to use. I don’t need lasers in my camera. I don’t need 100 megapixels in my camera. I don’t want a 4k display crammed into my pocket. And I don’t need an 8 core processor with 8 gigabytes of ram to check my email. This phone has exactly the specs it needs to have. Nothing more, nothing less. With that, it has exactly the price it needs to have. This is the first portable I’ve owned that I felt like I could actually use for what I wanted to do with it. It looks great, and it feels great. I don’t regret getting rid of the Nexus 5 at all. I’m sure other phones will come along, and I can only hope they take some queus from this incredible phone.</p>

        Lagrange Point Famicom English Hack
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>A few posts back I documented converting a Famicom game (Princess Tomato and the Salad Kingdom) to use the English translation. Since that went so well, I finally had the courage to try the game I really wanted to do: Lagrange Point. I think it’s fair for me to do a little background on this incredible game.</p>

<p><img src="/public/famicom/lagrangefront.jpg" alt="The coolest game ever?" /></p>

<p>Lagrange Point was developed by Konami and released in Japan for the Nintendo Famicom on April 26, 1991 (two days before I was born!). It’s a totally rad space opera rpg with some unique game mechanics that make it quite fun. It also had some audio features that I’ll go into more detail about.</p>

<p>The Famicom supported “expansion audio”. That is, game cartridges were able to have their own sound chips to expand what the Famicom was normally capable of making. Several games took advantage of this, such as Castlevania 3. In fact several Konami games used that feature. Perhaps one of the most unique was Lagrange Point. It was one of two games to use the Konami VRC-7 sound chip. The VRC-7 was extremely unique because it was an FM synthesis module. I won’t go into detail on what exactly FM sound synthesis is (mostly because I don’t really know), but I can show you an example of what it sounds like. The Sega Genesis was perhaps the most famous home console that used an FM chip (one very similar to the VRC-7) for it’s sound. Here’s a video to show what it sounds like:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISECbbAoBlw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>You can probably hear for yourself the difference a lot better than I can explain it to you. Now, imagine having that sound capability as well as the somewhat excellent sound capability the Famicom already had! Pure retro soundtrack goodness. I suggest you listen to Lagrange Point’s soundtrack while reading the rest of this post (and while you are, think about how primitive the original Mario Bros. sounded compared to something like this):</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/drwX7MbB_IE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Due to some complexities Lagrange Point has, it wasn’t until very recently that it was fan translated into English. Huge thanks to excellent hacker group Aeon Genesis (the guys that originally translated Cave Story as well) for the awesome job they did! Check out the translation patch <a href="http://agtp.romhack.net/project.php?id=lagrange">here</a>.</p>

<p>One difference between Lagrange Point and other Famicom games is that Konami themselves actually produced the boards. This is for our advantage! As you may have seen on my other cart hack, the mask rom and the eprom did not have equivilant pinouts so it was necessary to lift some of the legs and jump around with some wires. Luckilly, Konami used the standard eprom pinouts on their mask rom. What this means for us is that we can simply drop the new eprom in place of the old one! No lifting or jumping required! How thoughtful of them! So really it was quite simple to do.</p>

<p>I used a 27C4001 eprom made by ST Microelectronics. I was able to find 10 of them on eBay for $10 shipped. Not bad! You can use this chip in a lot of Famicom/NES reproductions, so you’re probably safe to stock up on them. Lagrange Point has only PRG-ROM so only one chip was required. Flash that puppy and drop it in and you’re in business!</p>

<p>There were a few things along the way that I’d like to have documented for other people that may want to do this. First, Lagrange Point takes about 1 full second to go from a grey screen to the starting screen. So if you’re just testing it out, make sure you don’t just turn the console on and off quickly thinking you’ve failed. Leave it on for a little bit!</p>

<p>I’ll repeat it again: you don’t need to lift any legs on the eprom. Just remove the mask rom and put your eprom in it’s place. Pin one should go on the bottom left. The mask rom also has a circle by pin one. Make sure your rom is the correct orientation!</p>

<p>I also was able to replace the battery and put a socket in it’s place for easy changing in the future. I used <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/5-x-New-Button-Coin-Cell-Battery-Socket-Holder-Case-CR2032-Black-/190622584472?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2c61fdce98">this</a> socket. It was just a little bit too long, so I had to bend the legs in a tiny bit, then I used a clamp to make it flush with the PCB while I soldered it in place. It fit back inside the cartridge shell with no problems!</p>

<p>Initially I thought I still needed to lift the legs and use wire jumpers. Once I figured out that I didn’t, I put the rom back in couldn’t get it to work. I may have not been leaving the console on long enough, or I may have damaged my rom. Eventually I just used a new eprom and it worked the first time! However, by removing and socketing the rom so many times, I damaged my board! Two pads were lifted, so I just traced the routes and jumped those pins to where they needed to go. Not ideal, but it works without problems. I absolutely hate to damage a game that’s so unique and relatively expensive.</p>

<p>I hope that this post can help others who might want to try this themselves, and hopefully prevent people from breaking their boards! Please get in contact with me if you have any questions at all!</p>

    <p>Mid-Week Summer Project!</p>

<p>Synopsys: In 1985 Nintendo released the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America to huge commercial success. This was particularly impressive due to the fact that the home video game market was in a slump caused by a market flood of cheaply made games and systems. Part of the reason the NES was such a success was that Nintendo marketed the console as a complete “home entertainment system” that was so much more than just a video game console. It wasn’t really, but the marketing paid off. That’s why it looks more like a VCR than a video game system, and the first release was even bundled with a robot! Two years earlier, Nintendo had dome something very similar in Japan by releasing the Family Computer, or as it’s more commonly known the Famicom. The two systems were essentially identical internally but had vastly different designs aesthetically. One important difference was that games for the Famicom had a smaller 60 pin form factor as opposed to the NES’ wider 72 pin connectors. Interestingly enough, several early NES games were just the Famicom pcbs with a converter inside. There were 2 models of the NES produced as well as 2 models of the Famicom. What’s interesting is that the 2nd model of both the NES and the Famicom looked almost exactly alike, but with some pretty important changes internally. The 2nd model NES (the “toploader”) only had RF out (remember the old single wire coaxial cable for your TV?) That produced pretty poor video. The 2nd model Famicom however featured full composite (RCA) video which produced arguably the best video signal of any of the 1st generation Nintendo consoles. So, I bought one. It’s still possible to play NES games with a 72 to 60 pin converter. However Famicom games are readily available and even after importing they’re usually cheaper than the NES counterparts. The one issue is that all the text is in Japanese! Some games that don’t have much text (Mario Bros.) are easily playable, but some games have more text and are nearly impossible. That’s where this project comes in! I’ll be converting a Japanese Famicom cartridge to the English version.</p>

<p>Details: NES/Famicom games are distributed online as ‘roms’ which is just one file. There were several different hardware revisions of cartridge PCB’s due to the limited way the NES could access them. In this project the game is fairly simple with only one rom chip and one ram chip. This makes the conversion easy since only one chip will have to be replaced. I popped the famicom game open (easier said than done!) and desoldered the ROM chip. Then I got the equivalent EPROM chip and flashed it with the English version of the game. Unfortunately the stander Mask ROM the cartridge uses isn’t pin compatible with a standard EPROM so a few legs of the chip needed to be lifted and rerouted to other ports on the PCB. Luckily only about 3 pins need to be changed. Pop it in and solder it up and I was in business! It’s been kind of a dream of mine to do this some day so I was pretty excited to see it worked. I can’t wait to do more!</p>

<p>Difficulty: Desoldering chips isn’t super fun…</p>

<p>Frustration: Skipping lunch</p>

<p>Payoff: Years of waiting and wishing!</p>

<p>Overall Project: A really nice learning experience</p>

        Android Wear/Moto 360 Review
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2015</span>

    <p><strong><em>Disclaimer: Below is a wall of rambling and poorly worded text. Don’t judge me TOO much…</em></strong></p>

<p>Just over a year ago, Google unveiled Android Wear, their version of Android specifically tailored for so-called “smart watches” or “wearables”. Among the first devices announced was the Moto 360. As the name implies, it was extremely notable due to it’s completely round display - something almost completely unheard of at the time (and even extremely uncommon today). Though the first two Android Wear devices launched on June 25, 2014 at Google’s I/O, the much anticipated Moto 360 wouldn’t be available until September 5. It seemed somewhat odd that the flagship smart watch wouldn’t be the first to arrive. It was announced at that same I/O that “everyone [there] whould receive their own Moto 360……when they are available…” Why wouldn’t Google just give everyone an LG G watch, since they were already available? The world may never know. That detail isn’t really the point of this post though.</p>

<p>My initial reaction to the announcement was excitement. It came before the Apple Watch was official in any way, so it was really the first of it’s kind. Sure there were things like the pebble and whatever samsung was scamming people into buying, but a major competitor backing their own OS was exciting thing. Developers would enjoy a very similar experience to what they were used to on normal Android (much the same way iOS developers were greeted by the Apple Watch tools). It seemed like an answer to an idea people have dreamt about for decades.</p>

<p>The announcement video had some examples of people using it. There were a lot of people biking. That was my first problem, I don’t bike. Like, ever. Still though, I could use it….driving? Yeah, I could use it driving, I reassured myself. They did things like open a garage by speaking to their watch using the familiar Google Now catchphrase “Ok, Google”. I was and still am a huge user of Google Now so I found that very exciting. I could have Google Now on my wrist at all times! But how did they open the garage? Does Android Wear come with the ability to integrate with all existing garage door openers? (As a side note, I would go on to develop my own IoT garage door opener, though we never made an Android Wear app and I never had a garage.)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrqZl2QIz0c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Watching the video a second (or third, or fourth) time, my excitment began to wain. Literally every single one of the examples they used were people doing things that I <em>never</em> did. Catching a plane, riding on a bus, giving kids a bath, surfing, <em>literally dancing to Chromeo while waiting in a long line</em>. Chromeo for heavens sake! Google either seriously over-estimated the average consumer, or they were genius in believing they could convince the average consumer that they were cool enough that they did all these things. And lets face it, if I were ever caught riding on a bus, I would be already staring at my phone! If by some miracle I was not, I <em>definately</em> would not be comfortable replying to a text with my voice, out loud, on a crowded bus. Now way, Jose.</p>

<p>So what would <em>I</em> do with a smart watch? I sit at a desk for 8 hours a day, drive home, and sit on a couch for the other 4-5 before going to bed. Now remember, I do use Google Now extensively, but all of the times I do, it is not inconvenient to take a phone out of my pocket. I don’t use Google Now while running down the street, raking leaves, or grocery shopping. Well, take that back, I use it grocery shopping when I’m trying to find out which song they’re playing on the radio (it’s always Fleetwood Mac). I use Google Now when I’m hanging out with my wife or friends and someone says “Which president built Mount Rushmore anyways?” It’s easier to whip my phone out, and from the lock screen say “Ok Google, which president built Mount Rushmore?” I also feel like it’s more conversational as well, as I don’t actually have to be looking at the screen while I’m doing any of those things. I can still be visually participating in a conversation. I do have to look at the phone once the result comes in, but that’s <em>still</em> conversational because I read it out loud, to everyone. It works very well. Doing any of this on a watch would not be any more or less convenient. But hey, it would definatly be cooler, right? Mr. James Bond over here figuring out how deep the mariana trench is by a simple voice command.</p>

<p>I was never really into watches either as a means for telling time or as an accessory. I have small girly wrists, so anything big or heavy is annoying to me. I had a Casio Calculator watch for a while though, and that was okay. Suffice to say I’m not really a watch persion. That was the first nail in the coffin, thinking back.</p>

<p>I think I remember telling myself I would be willing to try an Android Wear device if the price point was ~$100. The Moto 360 was announced for $249 and the LG G watch was $189. So that’s wear my willingness to try and adopt this technology came to a screeching halt. Since then, I’ve tentatively watched as the platform evolved and as a few more devices came along. All of them were still out of my price range. And with every review I still had an unanswered question: What does it actually <em>do</em>? More importantly, what would <em>I</em> do with it?</p>

<p>This progressed for about a year. The Apple Watch was announced to fanfair. I was impressed that people were so excited about it, given it’s cost. It reinforced my suspision that a man will buy anything at any price as long as it’s “cool” enough, and a woman will buy anything at any price as long as it’s “cute” enough. Now that I think about it though, I don’t actually know any women personally who own an Apple Watch. I guess Beyonce has a gold one that’s literally not possible to buy, but she’s not even a real person anyways right? After saying that I half expect Kanye to commandeer my keyboard! I think I’m safe though…</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, my first real interaction with wearables was indeed the Apple Watch. I just happened to be near an Apple store and had time to kill, so I wandered in to take a peek. I tapped the screen, twisted the wheel, pressed both buttons, and left having absolutely no idea what it actually did, or how someone would actually use it. It was definately cool though. In a way, it was remeniscint of the obelisk from Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Oddesey, where I was a monkey and the Apple Watch was the mysterioius obelesk. I’d love to say that upon touching it for the first time I started screeching, or was enlightened into the next plane of existance, but I didn’t and I wasn’t. Then looking at the price tag and having a mini heart attack for even touching something so expensive, I felt alone and fearful. I actually found the display unit more interesting than the watch itself.</p>

<p>That was before the Apple Watch was available for purchase.</p>

<p>Shortly after, it came out and a few friends started posting about it. It became a humorous habit of mine to exclaim “Wow, an iWatch! What does it do?” and listen to cobbled together responeses about how it’s nice to not have to pull out their <em>huge</em> iPhone 6/6+ (how ironic) any time they wanted to do something like check the weather. On the surface, the answer to that question seemed to be “Basically the same thing as my phone, but different and on my wrist” but deeper down the answer was almost dark: “I don’t really know.”</p>

<p>It was then I decided I must finally discover what one actually did with a smart watch. I resolved I must purchase a device and use it for maybe a week, in both extreme situations. On a vacation where I would be up and about in unfamiliar places needing constant directions and travel tips, and at my desk doing the same thing I did every day.</p>

<p>I purchased a Moto 360 for $249.99, but not before expliclity going over the return policy with the cashier. I really actually wanted an LG G watch since they’re a little smaller (and cheaper). They only had white/gold in stock though. So I ended up with the straight black Moto 360. I was actually pretty excited! I love all tech and gadgets, but more importantly I like tools that make my life easier or extend my (limited) abilities. You could say I enjoy checking out power drills as much as I do playing with the newest tablets.</p>

<p>We got back the our hotel room and I was eager to unbox it. I’ll simply state the packaging was nice enough. It comes in a clever little round box. I busted it out, along with the charger stand and cable. Interestingly, it didn’t come with a usb wall adapter and a seperate micro USB cable, it was all connected into one unit. The cable is plugged into the charging stand. The charging stand itself is actually kind of cool, you just set it on there and it charges by induction. There’s no magnet or anything to hold it in place, but it’s on a slight angle so if you had it on your desk or bedside it is easily viewable as a normal clock. That was actually the first thing I tried to do with it - plug it in. Doing that acheived nothing however, so a quick manual consultation told me to hold the only button down for a few seconds. Then, it showed the first signs of life. Again, not entirely unlike the aforementioned obelisk, it felt like magic.</p>

<p>After a few motorola logos and some snazzy boot animations, I was prompted to install the Android Wear app on my phone. After that I synced them together and I was off! There was a quick demo that I just kinda blazed through. The best way to describe the system is like Google Now with a clock. It functions literally the exact same way. A bunch of potentially useful “cards” show up in a stack. Things like pacakge shipments, weather, and appointment reminders show up. It works as well as Google Now, which is to say impressively well.</p>

<p>I don’t really like (slash never really learned how to read very well) analog clocks, so I switched the watchface out for one of the other preloaded ones. It’s important to note that the Moto 360 has <em>one</em> digital watchface preinstalled. In hindsight, it makes sense since this is uniquely round. All of the preloaded watchfaces are customizable to some extent, but to do anything you have to get another app on your phone, one the motorola made for cutomizing the watch. That was a little annoying to me, but whatever, it’s not anything new. I only tried it on one watchface, but I was able to customize the color of the digits as well as choosing white or black for the background. It worked decently well, but more importantly it whispered into my ear a long held suspiscion of mind: you can’t do <em>anything</em> on the watch itself. Sure, you can change which watchface you use, but you can’t change the way the watchface looks.</p>

<p>A long tap on the watchface itself lets you change the watch face. A short tap on the top part brings up a kind of menu or launcher that lets you chose from some default actions like navigations or setting a stopwatch. More than anything, it was just a list of example commands you could give Google Now. Ad the very bottom of the list, below even settings, is a “Start” option that shows all of the apps you have installed. Again though, this is really more an example of a command. For example, I can say “Ok Google, start USAA” and it will start the USAA app.</p>

<p>I use the term app somewhat liberally here. There’s no real way to install an app on the device itself. Instead you install apps on your phone and certain apps also have some kind of limited watch functionality. For example the USAA app asks me for my pin and then shows me a list my accounts and their balances card style. Now hey, that actually <em>is</em> kind of convenient! I can check my bank accounts with exactly 4 taps and one voice command as opposed to probably 4x that amount on the Android app itself. That may be more a flaw in the app design but <em>I want to believe!</em> What’s interesting is that there are some standalone ‘apps’ that will only function on the watch, mostly watch faces. You still have to install them on your phone, but there’s no way to tell from your phone which ones you have installed. I had to go into my settings and view all the apps installed on my phone till I noticed one that I had tried out and then abandoned. Uninstalling the Android Wear app won’t automatically uninstall watchfaces either.</p>

<p>The “Ok, Google” voice command detection works surprisingly well, but I wish I got a vibration feedback to let me know it was ready for a command. I’m convinced that the times this will be most useful will be when I’m not actually looking at the watch. Which brings up another point, the vibration is just a litle “meh”. It’s definately noticable, but I could also see myself missing it because it’s too subtle. Maybe that’s actually a feature though? It would be nice to not be distracted by this device when doing something important or intense.</p>

<p>I’d like to go back to the hardware breifly. As I mentioned, I’m not a watch person due to my girly small wrists. My wife ways the watch looks good on me, but it feels a bit heavy and bulky. It’s definatley nice though. The leather band is nothing out of this world, but it exactly what I want. A metal band would be unconfortable for me. The watch feels a bit thick, though I haven’t been able to compare that to any other watches so as far as I know that’s par for the course. The most interesting part for me is the glass on top. It seems thick, or that the screen is somehow far behind it. I’m not sure if the LCD is laminated to the glass or not. I’d venture a guess that it is, but that the glass is just thicker than on your average smartphone. Somehow the screen feels magnifyed by the glass, making me feel like I’m peering into a crystal ball. That effect may come from the rounded corners of the glass. If the screen is 50mm in diameter, the glass is 49mm and then 1mm of the rounded portion. You might think that the glass would be slightly larger than the screen, however in this configuration it creates an almost “endless pool” illusion in a way. Overall, I think I like that, though I don’t know what it would look like the other way.</p>

<p>The biggest flaw in the display is the portion at the bottom. There’s just a little black bar where they crammed the display driver. I mean, it’s got to go somewhere right? I can’t help but think the 360 theme would look so much better if it didn’t cost you screen space. I’d put money to say that the next version will eliminate that. The only other round watch, the LG G watch R solves this by just increasing the bezel around the screen. That would be unacceptable for me, making a watch that already feels big bigger is just not worth it. Still, it left me wishing for more.</p>

<p>The display itself is on the low res side. It’s a 320 x 290 screen. Compare that to the 312 x 390 for the 42mm Apple Watch and it doesn’t look bad on paper. I can’t speack much for how the Apple Watch screen looks in person, but I don’t remember it looking exceptionally low res. Maybe I’ve been spoiled by literally every other device I own, but looking at the watch face for the first time I was taken aback at how low res it looked. Even if I am spoiled, it just goes to show that a pixel density that low doesn’t cut it in this day and age. That will inevitably be solved someday, likely very soon. Don’t get me wrong, it doesn’t by any means look particularly bad, it’s just not great.</p>

<p>The first day using the watch had it’s ups and downs. Like I said before, I would be using this on a day that I would be more reliant on my phone than usual. I mostly needed help navigating, but on top of that I’d be doing all of my normal phone stuff: checking email, texts, social media, etc. The first time I raised the watch and said “Okay Google, navigate to…” it was a thrilling experience. I actually really enjoyed having it while driving as well. My phone would chime in with the next direction, and my wrist would vibrate and show a mini map of what I was going to be doing. Also at any time I could glance at the watch and see the same thing. I liked that because I often find myself wanting to peek at what the next direction will be and finagaling with a phone while driving can be <s>distracting</s> dangerous.</p>

<p>It should go without saying that the watch has a maximum potential usefulness as your phone does. If your phone is dead, the watch might as well not exist. I guess it can still technically tell the time, but that’s about it. With the moto 360 you probably won’t have to worry about that ever happening though. We left our hotel at about 11 am and by 3 pm it was at 9% battery. Now, I’ve owned both the Nexus 4 and 5 and despite constant complaints of poor battery life I’ve never been too disappointed by it. But 4 hours of use? Are you kidding me? That’s totally unacceptable. I don’t know what would constitute heavy use on a smart watch, but I just can’t believe naviagation falls into that category. And again, the watch screen is not on 100% of the time while navigating. It’s on maybe 10% of the time. So I have no idea what in the world could be draining the battery.</p>

<p>Charging isn’t particularly fast either. It’s within my due dilligence to actually time it, but I’d guess that it takes maybe 2 hours to go from 0 to 100. Another note is that because the charger itself doesn’t actually connect to the watch in any way, it’s nearly impossible to charge it on the go. I carry a portable battery that I use frequently, and it would be nice to be able to plug the watch in, throw it in my pack and forget about it. But the watch has to be perfectly positioned on the charging stand at all times. I ended up holding the watch on the charging stand while my wife was driving. Pathetic!</p>

<p>I think the best way I can describe the functionality of Android Wear is an external display for your phone that only shows you notifications. So really you just have to decide for yourself how helpful that might be. You <em>can</em> interact with the notifications, albeit in a limited way. Essentially you get the exact same level of interaction that you get in the notifications dropdown.</p>

<p>Using the watch while I wasn’t on the road was a little better, and a little worse. I got significantly better battery life. I could easily make it all day with 50% left. However, the reason for the improved battery life was clear: I never used it! Honestly, I get very few notifications throuought the day. I found that if I cross my arms with one arm on top of the watch, it turns on and starts wreaking all sorts of havoc. The times that I legitimately wanted to use it, it just didn’t work that well. I tried setting a timer for 36 minutes and rather than doing just that, I was prompted to chose a timer in 15 minute intervals. Since that makes a ton of sense? And even more bizarre, after that prompt I was asked to chose a time of day. I have no idea what that did though.</p>

<p>Another gripe I have with the software is that it shows you what I guess is a preview of your most recent notification. I think this is mostly a “feature” of the moto 360 specifically, but it keeps telling me how many steps I’ve taken today. I guess that’s kind of nice, but I don’t want to see it ALL THE TIME. I’d love to be able to just ask Google Now whenever I wanted that that information. I found a setting to disable notifications from that “app” but that did not disable the step counter.</p>

<p>I think that really that is my overall feeling about the Moto 360 and presumably Android Wear in general. Definately some cool tech, but it does too little where it should do more, it tries to do too much where it should do less. Overall it just didn’t really feel that great. When I bought the Moto 360, I had no intention of keeping it beyond the 30 day return policy. Secretly I hoped that something would catch and I’d really fall in love with it, but that just didn’t happen. I took it back early with no regrets. You could certainly argue that I already made up my mind before I even took the watch out of the box, but I really tried to take it for what it was. At the end of the day it’s a really cool peice of technology that just doesn’t really function that well. I’m hopeful that in future hardware and software updates the mechnaics of what could make a smart watch really useful will get tuned in, but at this point I’m not holding my breath.</p>
