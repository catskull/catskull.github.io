## Introduction

All of these were arranged and performed by me live. I recorded them from my keyboard straight into my computer. I am not a musician by any means, but I tried my best to incorporate elements of each style of music into the arrangement.

## Baroque

For this, I chose to use the harpsichord. The harpsichord is arguably the instrument most people would think of when they hear the term baroque music. It was used extensively during the period and likely lead to the development of the piano, which was just as important to classical and especially romantic period music. I also arranged it to use ritornello passages, where the same short section is repeated (most notably during the chorus). I used cleft notes to add to the complex nature found in baroque music. I have the lower hand accompanying the upper hand, adding to the complexity of the arrangement. Finally, I have the first and second verses, which are largely the same thing, with an outgrowth of them for the chorus.

## Classical

This arrangement features a duet with a violin and a cello. The string quartet was likely the most popular form of classical music. While this isn't a quartet, the duet gives very much the same kind of feeling. It is largely monophonic, with the violin playing the main melody and the cello playing a lower accompanying section. The stringed instruments give it a cheerful, yet refined kind of attitude that I think is very common in classical period music. Finally, while the violin is mostly the same volume throughout, the cello is more dynamic in volume to give emphasis to it's own part, the violin, and to shape the arrangement as a whole.

## Romantic

Life is interesting. I am by far the most familiar with romantic period music. I would argue that most people today, if they thought of the term "classical" music, would think of a romantic composition. Even though I'm the most familiar with it, this is by far my weakest arrangement of the three. Romantic music is almost overwhelming. I did my best, and this is what I tried to do: First, I used the piano. It was used extensively in romantic music, largely because a skilled performer could play something very complex but it would still sound pretty straight forward. The piano was also used because of it's dynamics. You could play something very softly, or very loudly, adding to the emotion common in romantic music. I have sections of this that are played at different volume levels, attempting to mimic that emotion and dynamics. It seems that many of the piano arrangements of the romantic era had complex sections that were played very quickly. That's what I tried to do here. It is also very dynamic in tempo. Some sections are played very slowly, while other are played quickly and with much vigor. Again, this adds a huge emotional factor that can hit you like a crashing wave. My arrangement also has sections with varying speeds.
