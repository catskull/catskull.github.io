steps:
  - step: >-
      Pat the beef cubes dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper,
      then toss in flour until evenly coated.
  - step: >-
      Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat.
      Sear the beef in batches until browned on all sides (about 5â€“7 minutes per
      batch). Remove the beef and set aside.
  - step: >-
      Add the chopped onion to the pot and sautÃ© for 3â€“4 minutes until softened
      and lightly browned. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for about 30
      seconds until fragrant.
  - step: >-
      Pour in red wine (if using) to deglaze the pot, scraping up any browned
      bits. Allow the wine to simmer for 1â€“2 minutes. Then stir in tomato paste,
      diced tomatoes (with juice), beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, dried
      thyme, dried rosemary, and bay leaf.
  - step: >-
      Return the seared beef to the pot. Add the carrots, celery, potatoes, and
      mushrooms (if using). Bring the mixture to a simmer.
  - step: >-
      Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the stew simmer for 1Â½ to 2
      hours until the beef is tender. Stir occasionally. If the stew is too
      thick, add extra broth or water; if too thin, simmer uncovered for the
      last 20â€“30 minutes.
  - step: >-
      Remove the bay leaf, taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Garnish with
      chopped fresh parsley and serve hot.
