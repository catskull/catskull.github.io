<div><span style="font-size: x-large;">Howdy, folks!</span></div><br>I decided to start a newsletter. If you’re reading this in your email inbox, that means you’re already subscribed which means that you’re pretty cool! If you’re&nbsp;<a href="https://catskull.net/newsletter">reading this on my blog</a>&nbsp;then you’re still cool, but you can become even cooler by getting on my mailing list.<br><br>All you need to do is&nbsp;<a href="mailto:bro@catskull.net?subject=Sign%20me%20up%20for%20your%20newsletter&amp;body=Sign%20me%20up!%0D%0A%0D%0AThanks">send me an email</a>&nbsp;and I’ll add you to the list. Otherwise,&nbsp;reading on the website&nbsp;works great either way.<br><br><font size="5">What is this newsletter?</font><div><font size="5"><br></font></div><div>I know that I can be a bit wild-brained and move through a lot of deep interests and hobbies pretty quickly. I like sharing what I’m doing and learning, but I have a hard time filtering it down into something digestible for a non-insane person.</div><div><br></div><div>This is an attempt to make it as easy as possible for you to be my friend and know what’s going on in my life.</div><div><br></div><div><font size="5">Recent News</font></div><div><img src="/assets/images/newsletters/2025-05-08/5D0C0DB4-E6B9-438A-8120-FB5ACB6A4DA0/FAB88F72-5B20-44D2-8B39-0F392D27CABE_1_105_c.jpeg" alt="FAB88F72-5B20-44D2-8B39-0F392D27CABE_1_105_c.jpeg"></div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li>I took a few days off and went solo overloading through the west Utah desert.

Even now, it’s difficult to let you know that I did it.</li><li>Related, I’ve been teaching the Sunday School class at my church for the last few years and I actually really enjoy it. I teach once a month so let me know if you ever want to come!</li><li>I published the first part of a science fiction series I’ve been working on for the better part of my life. It’s called "<a href="https://catskull.net/prizem-part-1-postoaisys-ao.html">Prizem Part 1: After Oaisys (AO)</a>” and it would actually mean the absolute world to me if you’d read it.</li><li>Fictionist, one of my favorite bands released a new album and&nbsp;<a href="https://catskull.net/fictionist-repeater-album-review.html">I wrote a review of it</a>, which includes some personal biographical info about me as well.</li></ul><div><br></div></div><div><font size="5">Spotlight</font></div><div>Since this is the first release of the newsletter, I took the time to go through and try and document where my current creative output is.</div><div><br></div><div>The places where I’m most active are:</div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li><a href="https://mastodon.social/@dareelcatskull">Mastodon</a></li><ul class="MailOutline"><li>the reactor core</li><li>free-flowing thoughts</li><li>memes</li></ul><li><a href="http://Catskull.net">Catskull.net</a></li><ul class="MailOutline"><li>How-To’s</li><ul class="MailOutline"><li>Whenever I figure out how to do something difficult, I try to take time to write down some instructions.
