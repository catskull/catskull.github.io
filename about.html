  I'm a freelance web developer and electrical engineering student. I enjoy technology, electronics, non-fiction, and spending time with my wife. We live in Provo, Utah. We're expecting our first child in May and couldn't be more excited! I'm always looking for interesting things to do and learn about, so please feel free to <a href="follow.html">contact me!</a>
