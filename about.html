I am a creative technologist and product developer. My greatest career accomplishment has been leading internship programs, working closely with early-career engineers to help them navigate the transition into full-time work. I have great coworkers and managers to thank for my success, and together we’ve built startups that have collectively sold for over $1.5 billion. I’m happiest when I’m deep in the product-development cycle, and I’ve been able to use my skills and perspective to deliver products that help consumers navigate the most complicated financial processes of their lives—home and auto purchases. I founded a hardware company, fully bootstrapped, and grew it to $80k in yearly revenue while working full-time at a startup. This led me to work with artists, musicians, and technologists across the world. I love building products to solve customers’ problems.

My greatest fulfillment comes from my wife of 13 years and our four children. We live in Southern Utah and love spending time together. Each of my kids has a unique personality and brings a lot of extra insight into life.

I am always researching everything. As a kid, I dreamed of having a Game Boy full of books. In my teens, I wanted a “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” to carry around as a reference. Now I have an iPhone with Wikipedia on it, and I read it. Surprisingly, I’m not very interested in reading most books, but I like reading about books—and anything else—on Wikipedia. The more I learn, the more similar things become. What I really appreciate is people. Perspectives. I am so fascinated that my earnestness is often misinterpreted as judgment. People have an infinite capacity to adapt and find happiness. Ultimately, I’m on a personal journey to live my life to the fullest extent possible. Self-awareness and authenticity help me get the most out of life.

This website is somewhere in between a journal, project log, portfolio, exhibit, utility, reference, tech demo, and junk drawer. It’s my personal home page.
